              " Document(page_content=' \\n CEO Letter \\nDear Shareholders, \\nI’m proud to report that Wells Fargo continued to make \\nprogress on our priorities in 2022. Our underlying financial performance is improving, we are moving forward on our risk, control and regulatory agenda, we are focusing on businesses where we can generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns, we continue to strengthen the leadership team, and we are executing on our strategic objectives. While we have made progress, our work is not complete and we remain focused on successful and timely execution of our multi-year journey to complete our risk and control work and to move forward with our businesses. \\nStronger financial performance \\nOur financial performance benefitted as we continued to drive improved efficiency, and it was positively impacted by both rising rates and a benign credit environment. \\nIn 2022, Wells Fargo generated $13.2 billion in net income, or \\n$3.17 per common share. Our results were significantly impacted by $7 billion of operating losses, primarily related to putting historical issues behind us, including litigation, regulatory matters, and customer remediations. However, our performance excluding those items was solid and demonstrates the continued progress we are making to improve returns. \\nOur revenue decreased 6% from the previous year. The higher \\nrate environment and good loan growth drove strong growth in net interest income, which was up 26% from a year ago. However, this growth was more than offset by lower net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking, and investment advisory and other asset-based fees reflecting market conditions, as well as the lost revenue related to businesses we sold in 2021. \\nExpenses increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting higher \\noperating losses primarily related to putting historical matters behind us, as noted above. Excluding operating losses, noninterest expense declined from a year ago, reflecting continued progress on our efficiency initiatives and the impact from business sales. We achieved these efficiency gains while we made continued investments in our risk and control infrastructure and in strategic initiatives across our businesses, and in the face of continued inflationary pressures. \\nCredit quality remained strong, but, as expected, losses started \\nto slowly increase in the second half of the year off their historical lows. Our net charge-off rate declined from 18 basis points in 2021 to 17 basis points in 2022, and our allowance for credit losses declined by $75 million in 2022, as our reserve release in the first quarter was slightly larger than the reserve builds we had in the last three quarters of the year. \\nLoans outstanding increased by 7% from one year ago, with \\ngrowth in both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer Banking and Lending grew 4%, driven by growth in residential mortgage and credit card, which offset a decline in auto loans. Both Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking had strong loan growth, with commercial loans up 9% from a year ago, driven by growth across all asset classes. Average deposits in 2022 decreased 1% to $1.42 trillion, as higher market rates spurred customers to look for higher yielding alternatives, and consumers continued to spend savings that built up during the pandemic. \\nOur capital levels remained well above our required regulatory \\nminimums plus buffers. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2022 from $0.20 per share to $0.25 per share and then to $0.30 in the third quarter of 2022. While we did not repurchase any common stock in the last three quarters of 2022, we have repurchased shares in the first quarter of 2023. \\nOur return on equity was 7.5% and our return on tangible \\ncommon equity (ROTCE) was 9.0%\\n1. Both of these ratios were \\nimpacted by the operating losses I highlighted earlier. \\nIn my shareholder letter over the past two years, I have \\ndiscussed our path to higher returns. Since 2020, we have executed on a number of important items to improve our returns, including returning $16 billion to shareholders through net common stock repurchases, increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.30 per share, and delivering approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense saves. Based on these actions and others that are in flight, we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher returning businesses; execute on efficiency initiatives; and benefit from the investments we are making in our businesses. \\n1 Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Financial Review – Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. \\n2022 Annual Report i ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' \\n \\n \\n We are actively watching the \\neconomy \\nConsumers \\nAfter a period of strong economic growth and low \\nunemployment, the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates aggressively with a goal of combatting high inflation. Increasing interest rates and a slowing economy have caused headwinds for some of our customers, but our customers have largely remained resilient over the past year, with deposit balances, consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels. \\nConsumer credit card spend continued to be strong in 2022, \\nwith spending up 25% compared with 2021, which reflects the benefit of new Wells Fargo product launches. Almost all spending categories had double-digit spend growth year over year. Consumer debit card spend slowed to 3% growth in 2022 compared to 2021. Growth was driven by ticket size since transaction volume was flat year-over-year, and discretionary spend outpaced non-discretionary spend. \\nAt the same time, we are carefully watching the impact of higher \\nrates and we expect to see deposit balances continue to decrease and credit quality to continue to weaken. For certain cohorts of customers, average deposit balances are below pre-pandemic levels, and we are closely monitoring activity for signs of potential stress. For our borrowers, we are working to limit the risk – both to them and to us – of overextension. We have taken selective actions across our consumer lending businesses to mitigate risks associated with inflation and increased debt leverage. In our auto business, we have adjusted policies to address risk associated with collateral value declines and inflationary pressures on consumers’ ability to pay. In home lending, we have tightened loan-to-value policies nationally and even more so in local markets that have elevated home value risk. Additionally, in our card business, we have tightened our lending policy to focus on applicants who may be exhibiting debt-seeking behavior. \\nBusinesses \\nCommercial loans grew 9% in 2022, with most of the growth in \\nthe first half of the year. Higher inventory levels contributed to increased working capital needs, which drove higher utilization rates. However, utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year, and current data is not pointing to additional inventory builds, which indicates most businesses are carefully managing inventory levels amid slowing demand. \\nWe continue to closely monitor the most pandemic-impacted \\nsectors and inflation-sensitive industries in our commercial portfolio. This includes: \\n•\\t Updating underwriting guidelines to include interest-rate \\nsensitivity to leveraged loans •\\t Analyzing supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, and the impact of a potential recession \\n•\\t Making timely updates to our watchlist \\nThe Commercial Real Estate office market is showing signs of weakness due to lower demand, driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance. Challenging economic and capital market conditions are also buffeting the office market, and while we haven’t seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure. Specifically, we have issued underwriting guidance for navigating current conditions, including limited tolerance for new credit policy exceptions, increasing minimum debt yield thresholds, and stress testing and expansion of the watchlist process, including additional emphasis on the office market. \\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2023, we are prepared for a \\nrange of scenarios. As a large lender to both consumers and businesses in the United States, we have significant credit exposure across our businesses, and as the Federal Reserve continues to take action to reduce inflation, we will continue to monitor both the markets and our own customer data and will react accordingly. If our view of economic stress deteriorates from our view at the end of 2022, we will likely add to credit loss reserves during 2023. \\nMoving forward on our risk, control, \\nand regulatory agenda \\nWe continue to move forward with the foundational work of \\nbuilding out a risk and control framework appropriate for our company. This multi-year journey continues to be about setting clear priorities, cultural change, and operational execution. I have been clear and consistently reinforce that this foundational work is our top priority. This should always be the case for a bank such as ours, but this has not always been the case, so reinforcement is necessary. We remain confident in our ability to complete this work and build appropriate risk, control, and operational excellence into our culture. \\nThe Acting Comptroller of the Currency gave an important \\nspeech in January addressing the potential difficulties of managing a large bank. Given that the OCC is a key supervisor of ours, we take the speech seriously and are focused on its key messages. \\nThe speech focused on the view that there are limits to an \\norganization’s manageability based on size and, if so, that the most efficient and effective way to fix this is to compel its simplification. I am not in a position to agree or disagree with this premise, but I am in a position to have the strong point of view that Wells Fargo is not too big or complex to manage. Our shortcomings are not structural, but they are the result of historically ineffective management and the lack of proper prioritization of building out an appropriate risk and control environment that will ultimately take multiple years to correct. \\nii ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' \\n  We are large but are far less complex than many with whom we \\ncompete. In fact, we have more similarities with regional banks than other global systemically important banks (GSIBs), and strong and effective risk management processes should scale to a company of our size. In addition, we have acted and will continue to act on our own to simplify our company and reduce operational complexity and risk, as I detail in the section later in this letter entitled “Executing on Strategic Objectives.” \\nOperating at a broad scale but with less complexity than peers \\n1. \\t We are primarily a US domestic bank and we do not have \\nthe many complexities that running large-scale international businesses bring. Our legal entity structure, extent of international regulatory oversight and physical footprint are far simpler than many of our competitors. Approximately 90% of our revenues come from U.S. clients or activities of non-U.S. clients in the U.S. Our businesses outside the U.S. primarily support our U.S. customer base. We are very happy with our existing footprint and are not looking beyond for growth opportunities. \\n2. \\t Our products are not complex compared with those offered by other banks and are similar to those offered by smaller institutions. We predominantly provide the same products and services as regional and smaller, more local banks. We take deposits, provide financing, move money, and provide financial advice for our customers. Our trading activities and the size of our market risk are relatively small compared to other large GSIBs. \\n3. \\t Scale in each of our businesses should not make us more complex. Our distribution methods are similar to smaller institutions. We manage a branch network, have relationship managers across our markets, market through the internet, traditional advertising, direct mail, and word of mouth, and we rely on our local reputation. The controls necessary to manage a network of 4,000+ branches are similar to those necessary to manage a smaller branch network. The same is true for managing relationship managers, marketing, and protecting our reputation. Senior management should be involved at a detailed level, but all institutions should have and rely on defined control frameworks in place that are effective at risk management, regardless of individuals in a seat. These frameworks can effectively scale to a bank of our size. \\n4. \\t Our customers benefit from our size and reach. Wells Fargo has nearly 4,600 retail bank branches, with a presence in 25 of the largest 30 markets in the U.S. A Wells Fargo branch or ATM is within 2 miles of over half of U.S. Census households and small businesses in our footprint. The range of banking services we provide helps us build full relationships with individuals and companies, allowing us to see a full picture of their personal, family, and/or business financial needs, and to meet these needs. We have the ability to invest in technology to make it faster, safer, and more transparent for our customers to handle their banking needs. In addition, our resources allow us to innovate quickly, developing new products, services, and digitized experiences to meet constantly changing consumer and business expectations. These capabilities, along with our size and reach, are of tangible benefit to consumers across the country, whether they live in large cities or more rural areas, and also to the U.S. economy as a whole. \\nManaging the company with significantly heightened discipline \\nWe agree that there are also traits that management should \\navoid as they grow. These signs are familiar to us, as we identified them as historical behaviors at Wells Fargo when I arrived. We viewed them then – as we do now – as unacceptable. Our approach today is dramatically different than it was at Wells Fargo in the past and we will continue to work so it becomes part of our culture at all levels in the organization. \\n1. \\t Don’t hide behind materiality – As a large institution we \\nknow we cannot let our size hide potential issues. We must think about raw numbers, not just percentages which are indexed to a large customer base, asset base, or capital base. We have built functions and processes to review customer complaints, employee allegations, and issues raised from outside the company, and aim to use them to identify issues and themes so we can address them and make changes as required. \\n2. \\t Don’t assume incidents are isolated – One of the advantages large institutions have is the amount of data and information we see and have, but we must use it expeditiously. Individual incidents provide data points which can help us learn and react, and we should treat each as such. We strive to make data-driven decisions and to explore whether incidents that can appear isolated can in fact have broader application elsewhere in the company. \\n3. \\t Identify weaknesses ourselves and address them quickly – The Acting Comptroller stated that “the business of banking is operationally intensive. Even at banks with strong teams and robust risk management systems and controls, mistakes and problems can arise. Well-managed banks identify such problems early and often, address them quickly, and take steps to prevent their recurrence.” We agree completely. Many of the historical issues we continue to work through were identified by regulators, not by us. We are changing this, emphasizing our responsibility to self-identify more issues and address them with a heightened sense of urgency. As we implement our risk and control framework, we will likely identify more issues and move with haste to implement compensating and ultimately permanent controls. Our risk and control framework is not a project, but an ongoing set of actions, and it will be part of our culture. \\n4. \\t Hubris, contempt, and indifference are unacceptable and dangerous traits – We cannot believe that we know better \\n2022 Annual \\nReport iii ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' \\n \\n than others and need to react with seriousness and urgency \\nwhen issues are raised – whether from employees, \\ncustomers, regulators, or others outside the company. \\nEvery issue raised has the opportunity to be a learning \\nmoment and we should also proactively look at our \\ncompetitors to learn as well. \\n5. \\t Integration of mergers is more than a short-term \\ntechnology conversion – While we have not had a merger-\\nrelated systems integration in my time at Wells Fargo, we \\nagree that “simply stitch[ing]…systems together” can \\ncause a proliferation of issues. It is critical to merge and \\nsimplify platforms, whether merger-related or as part of a \\ncustomer service strategy, as the reduced complexity in the \\nnumber of platforms should make it easier to properly serve \\ncustomers. For example, asking customer-service \\nrepresentatives to learn multiple systems to provide the \\nsame information creates more operational risk and the \\npossibility of a poor customer experience. \\n But these platform mergers should be the beginning of \\nintegration, not the end. This is true looking both from our \\nperspective and the customer perspective. Customers think \\nof us as one company, not as separate relationships with \\nindividual lines of business. They want to see their \\ninformation seamlessly and be able to transact with us \\neasily across all of their products. Unless we integrate our \\nplatforms, we will either not appear as one company to the \\ncustomer, or we will create workarounds to try and \\naccomplish this, which creates unneeded operational risk. A \\nmajor competitive advantage of Wells Fargo is serving our \\ncustomers across a broad range of products, but we can \\nonly do so effectively with common platforms. \\n The same is true of data platforms. Pulling customer data \\nfrom multiple platforms is operationally complex and \\nexpensive. Common data platforms across our company are \\ncritical. We rely on this for financial reporting, regulatory \\nreporting, risk reporting, and the ability to assess a \\ncustomer relationship holistically. \\n And finally, it is a mistake to lose sight of aged platforms, to \\nnot invest in improving them and to not move to new ones. \\nNew software and hardware solutions make it easier to \\nreduce complexity and properly serve customers, and when \\nthese solutions are part of a program with a clear target \\nstate, they should significantly reduce operational \\ncomplexity. \\n Recognizing this, Wells Fargo is implementing a modern \\ntechnology stack that is cloud-native and therefore more \\nelastic and resilient. We are applying this stack for the \\nvarious product domains that we are modernizing across \\nour businesses. Examples include a more modern digital \\ndesktop for our financial advisors in Wealth and Investment \\nManagement, our value-at-risk models in Corporate and \\nInvestment Banking, and our payment platforms across \\nbusinesses. These modernization initiatives are guided \\ntop-down by a product and platform architecture that sets clear boundaries and expectations for teams. In addition to \\nthis, the hosting of our platforms is more and more \\nmigrating to a combination of private and public cloud, \\npowered by our partnerships with Google and Microsoft. \\nThis also is leading to faster innovation by plugging in \\ninnovative services provided by these cloud providers into \\nour platforms. \\n In parallel to these modernization efforts, we are also \\nenhancing the way we deliver software and the developer \\nexperience. We are implementing new cloud-native tool-\\nchains that allow our developers to have the experience that \\nthey deserve: on-demand, instant, elastic and with \\nembedded automated controls. \\nFurther taking stock of where we stand – why haven’t we \\ncompleted our risk and regulatory work \\nI am frequently asked why our risk and regulatory work is not \\ncomplete though we have been publicly reprimanded, have a \\ngrowth constraint, and I have been leading the company for over \\n3 years. I wish my job was merely to complete work that was well \\nunderway, but unfortunately this was not the case. Simply said, \\nthe work to build the appropriate risk and control infrastructure \\nand close consent orders takes years when managed effectively, \\nand we were not as far along as I had expected when I arrived. \\nMuch work was needed to build what is necessary to properly \\naccomplish the work. \\nWhen I arrived, we did not have the culture, effective processes, \\nor appropriate management oversight in place to remediate \\nweaknesses on a timely basis. Today, we approach these issues \\ndifferently. This management team (the broad team – not just \\nme) has the skills and experience and is now responsible for \\nclosing our consent orders. We have changed and implemented \\nmuch to put ourselves in a position to have the confidence that \\nwe can accomplish this. The specifics of our regulatory \\nremediation plans are confidential, and while we are not where \\nwe need to be, I believe that our position is significantly \\nimproved and that we will reach our goals. We are committed to \\nmaking all necessary resources available to meet our obligations. \\nI have said we are a different company today, and in this \\nsub-section, I provide some examples. \\n1. \\t When I arrived at the company in 2019, we had 12 open, \\npublic enforcement actions. Given this and the other \\ncontrol issues we needed to assess, it took many months to \\nunderstand the depth and breadth of the weaknesses and \\nwhat was required to complete the work. \\n2. \\t We then went about recruiting a mostly new management \\nteam with the experience and skills that we did not \\nsufficiently have at the company. A large portion of the \\nOperating Committee was recruited during 2020 and they \\nthen needed to do their own assessments and develop \\nplans. They then needed several years to build out their \\nteams. \\niv ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' \\n \\n 3. \\t For each consent order Matters Requiring Attention \\n(MRAs), and other control gaps identified, we needed to \\nbuild detailed plans that satisfied both us and our \\nregulators. Our plans are now detailed and have hundreds of \\ndeliverables with designated delivery dates. Many of our \\nconsent orders have work that relies on work from another \\norder, so any slippage on one plan can impact another. Our \\nability to assess all of this accurately for work to be done \\nover multiple years has not been perfect, and we have \\nmissed some deliverables, but we have learned, adjusted, \\nand continue to move forward. \\n4. \\t We needed to build processes to manage these across the \\ncompany. Building reporting and setting up management \\nreview structures for these activities has been critical to \\nmoving the work forward. Most of these did not exist or \\nwere ineffective, and we now believe we have much more \\neffective reporting and processes in place to provide \\nappropriate oversight and allow us to identify issues early \\nso we can course-correct. \\n5. \\t We did not have the resources necessary to accomplish this \\nwork when I arrived. We have added close to 10,000 people \\nacross numerous risk- and control-related groups and have \\nspent approximately $2 billion more in 2022 than in 2018 in \\nthese areas. We are committed to make the investments \\nneeded to complete the work. \\n6. \\t And we had to build the management disciplines and \\nculture to govern and execute such a large body of work. \\nOur Operating Committee reviews risk and regulatory \\nprogress and escalations on a weekly basis. We provide \\ndetailed reporting to the full board and appropriate \\ncommittees so they can provide oversight. These reviews \\nare systematic and detailed, and they are helping us provide \\nthe appropriate oversight and involvement to accomplish \\nthe work. \\nI should add that we had to do all of this during the very worst of \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. While we were not alone in dealing \\nwith the complexities of work from home, social distancing and \\nmeeting the needs of customers during a pandemic, we were \\nalone in what we had to build, and doing so in a remote working \\nenvironment increased the difficulty level significantly. \\nSome have suggested that banks view enforcement actions and \\nfines as a cost of doing business, but I can tell you that today, \\nnothing is further from the truth at Wells Fargo. We view any \\nsuch action by our regulators as something that requires \\nimmediate management attention. We aim both to avoid the \\nnecessity of such action by doing the work ourselves and, when \\nregulators do take enforcement action against us, we follow a \\ndisciplined process to work towards closure, again with all \\nnecessary resources available for the effort. \\nThe negative impact on our reputation of having not fulfilled our \\nobligations is clear. Simply put, failure to satisfy our regulatory \\nrequirements carries significant consequences for our company. \\nOn the other hand, fulfilling our obligations and building an appropriate risk and control framework will allow us to build a \\nstrong reputation amongst a broad set of stakeholders. So why \\ndo we have so many consent orders that have been open for \\nextended periods? Again, our historical practices were \\ninadequate, and it has taken time to build what is necessary to \\nchange our historical inadequacies. \\nSo as I look at our situation today, the failure of Wells Fargo to \\ncomplete its work appropriately has resulted in multiple consent \\norders, fines, and an asset cap. But I can say confidently that we \\nhave taken significant actions including focusing and simplifying \\nthe company, refreshing the board, replacing most of the senior \\nmanagement team, and are now moving forward to correct past \\ndeficiencies. We have the willingness and the ability to complete \\nthe work. \\nAnd to be clear, we are committed to prioritizing this work \\nabove all else by devoting all necessary resources to the effort. \\nOur planning is designed to ensure other activities do not \\ninterfere with this top priority. If we have a conflict, our risk and \\ncontrol work comes first. \\nI have said our progress will likely not be a straight line. We \\ncontinue to resolve issues that were found years ago or are the \\nresult of the inadequate control environment that existed when \\nwe arrived at the company. This means that resolution of \\noutstanding issues such as litigation, customer remediations or \\nregulatory investigations have and could continue to have \\nfinancial impacts. Additionally, until our work is complete, we will \\nlikely find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may \\nresult in additional regulatory actions. \\nFinally, as we continue to execute on our detailed plans, given \\nthe scope and complexity of our work, we may miss some \\ninterim milestones. We recognize the importance of meeting \\nmilestones that we ourselves set, but perfection is unlikely. \\nWhen we discover an issue, we act quickly to course-correct and \\ndo what we can to get back on schedule. This is frustrating for us \\nand others outside the company but is not indicative of our \\nwillingness or ability to complete our work. Rather, it is an \\nobstacle that presents itself in nearly any large-scale, multi-year \\ntransformation. \\nWhen Wells Fargo faces criticism about where we stand, I \\nunderstand the sentiment. I hope this section has provided \\ndetailed context and is helpful in providing an understanding of \\nwhat we are doing to close our gaps. This team is taking decisive \\naction to move our company past these issues. \\nLeadership Team \\nKey to transforming the company, changing our culture, and \\nrealizing the full strength of our franchise is having the best \\nmanagement team in place. Since I joined the company in 2019, \\n12 of our 17 Operating Committee members are new to Wells \\nFargo and 15 are new to their roles. In 2022, we put in place a \\nnew Chief Auditor, a new Chief Risk Officer, a new head of \\nConsumer Lending, and a new head of Diverse Segments, \\nRepresentation and Inclusion. \\n2022 Annual Report v ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' \\n \\n \\n \\n We continue to refresh our management ranks more broadly. \\nOver 80% of our senior executive leaders – a group of approximately 150 people, most of whom report to Operating Committee members – are new to their roles since 2019, and nearly 60% are new to the company over the same time period. Over 30% of the individuals in this senior executive cohort began in new roles in 2022 or 2023. New leaders who have joined over the past several years bring important experience that is necessary for our journey. \\nExecuting on Strategic Objectives \\nSimplifying our business \\nWe continue to review the strategic positioning of the company \\nand are focusing our efforts on building products and services that are core to serving our clients. This focus has led us to decisions to sell, downsize, or curtail multiple businesses. These decisions simplify the company, reduce operational complexity and risk, and allow us to focus on both our core risk and control buildout and ways to serve our customers in our core franchises. There are several examples since I joined the company in 2019. \\nIn January 2023, we announced plans to simplify our Home \\nLending business and will primarily serve bank and wealth management customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. As part of this shift, we announced our plans to exit the Correspondent business, reduce the size of our Servicing portfolio, and optimize our Retail team so it aligns with our narrower customer focus. These actions will allow us to reduce risk in the Home Lending business while continuing making homeownership possible to thousands of Americans. \\nOver the past year, we have taken several additional steps to \\nsimplify the way we operate. For instance, we have: \\n•\\t Implemented a cloud-native operating model which will \\nenable us to reduce reliance on older, less stable platforms and allows us to innovate faster \\n•\\t Centrally organized our Control Management teams, to enable better coordination across our businesses \\n•\\t Streamlined our divisional leadership in Wells Fargo Advisors, moving from eight regional divisions to four \\n•\\t Combined Treasury Services platforms across Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking \\nLooking further back to 2021, 2020, and 2019, we have: \\n•\\t Sold Wells Fargo Asset Management \\n•\\t Sold our Corporate Trust Services business \\n•\\t Sold our student lending portfolio and stopped the \\norigination of new student loans \\n•\\t Exited our international wealth management segment \\n•\\t Sold our Canadian direct equipment finance business •\\t Stopped offering new home equity lines and loans \\n•\\t Exited the direct Auto business \\n•\\t Stopped originating personal lines of credit \\n•\\t Sold our Institutional Retirement and Trust business \\n•\\t In addition, over the past several years, we have closed over a dozen representative offices globally to better focus our international business, including offices in Asia, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and elsewhere. \\nGoing forward, we will continue to evaluate our businesses with an eye toward reducing complexity, increasing risk-adjusted returns, and focusing our resources on the most important products and services our customers require. Market dynamics change, the competitive environment changes, regulatory expectations evolve and we must adjust our business accordingly. \\nFocusing on customer needs and expectations \\nEach of our businesses is working to transform how we serve our \\ncustomers by offering focused, innovative products and solutions. Many of the initiatives underway reduce risk in the company and we evaluate new initiatives to consider the potential impact on our control environment. Some examples are below. \\nOur Consumer Businesses: Consumer and Small Business \\nBanking, Consumer Lending, and Wealth and Investment Management \\n•\\t We rolled out our new consumer mobile app with a simpler, \\nmore intuitive user experience which has improved customer satisfaction. We also completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant, which provides a more personalized, convenient, and simple consumer banking experience. Fargo is currently live for eligible employees and is set to begin rolling out to customers during the first half of this year. Providing such digitized services directly to our customers reduces operational complexity in our service centers and increases customer satisfaction. \\n•\\t We continued to improve our credit card offerings including launching two new cards – Wells Fargo Autograph and BILT. While we describe these as new products, these are actually updated products in a business we have been in for many years. \\n•\\t We launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses to provide a more comprehensive, relevant, and integrated offering for our clients. \\n•\\t We also relaunched Intuitive Investor in our Wealth and Investment Management segment, making it easier for customers to invest with a streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investment. \\nvi ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' \\n \\n  Our Wholesale Businesses: Commercial Banking and Corporate \\nand Investment Banking  \\n•\\t We have made several hires in Corporate and Investment \\nBanking that have received some press. These hires are in industries we currently serve and products we currently offer, but the individuals bring new expertise to Wells Fargo. \\n•\\t We continued to enhance the partnership within our commercial businesses to bring Corporate and Investment Banking products such as foreign exchange and M&A advisory services to our middle-market corporate clients. \\n•\\t In December we announced Vantage, an enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients’ specific needs. \\n•\\t Over the past year our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for commercial and corporate clients, invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramped-up and grew product offerings in consumer lending, and began developing commercial lending solutions. \\nEvolving our approach to technology \\nTechnology is helping us better serve our consumer and \\ncorporate clients. Our technology talent is modernizing platforms for our customers, clients and colleagues. Specific areas of focus are: \\n•\\t A cross-product pricing platform \\n•\\t Digitization of our lending origination platforms across Small \\nBusiness, Commercial and Corporate Banking \\n•\\t Continued modernization of our Treasury Services and Payments platforms \\n•\\t Strengthening our technological capabilities in fraud prevention \\n•\\t Modernizing key corporate risk platforms \\n•\\t Refreshing our Auto loans platform \\nThese enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of the initiatives we have planned as part of our multi-year digital transformation. \\nSeeing early returns from this work \\nOur work to build better, more customer-focused products and \\na more technology-enabled company is generating measurable returns. For instance: \\n•\\t In Consumer and Small Business Banking, mobile active \\ncustomers grew 4% from a year ago. \\n•\\t The new credit cards I mentioned above helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022, and we’ve continued to maintain strong credit profiles. The average FICO score of our new accounts in 2022 was 773, compared to 761 for the 2019 vintage. \\n•\\t In Wealth and Investment Management, total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago. \\n•\\t Our U.S. investment banking market share was 3.2% in 2022, up 61 basis points versus 2021. We had the #7 ranking in this year’s U.S. investment banking league tables, up two spots from 2021. \\n•\\t As a company, we deliver many solutions nowadays in sprints, reducing our through-put time by as much as 60% compared to 2020. \\nESG, communities and customer \\ncentricity \\nAs I look back at 2022, I’m enthusiastic about the progress we’ve \\nmade in serving our communities and our customers, and I feel even better about the opportunities ahead. \\nLet me start with the changes we made during the year to help \\nmillions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included: \\n•\\t The elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees \\nfor customers enrolled in Overdraft Protection. \\n•\\t Early Pay Day, making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early. \\n•\\t Extra Day Grace, giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. \\n•\\t And in the fourth quarter we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only, small-dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Teams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in just a few months. Though it’s still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations. \\nThe above actions build on services we’ve introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, a consumer banking account with no overdraft fees. We now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago. \\nBeyond our customers, we have an important responsibility to \\nstrengthen the communities we serve. We continued that work in 2022. This was true on several fronts. \\nSupporting homeownership \\n•\\t We launched a Special Purpose Credit Program in 2022, \\ncommitting $150 million to advance racial equity in homeownership, with an additional $100 million investment towards this racial equity effort announced in 2023. \\n•\\t We established Wealth Opportunities Restored through Homeownership, or WORTH, a $60 million national effort to address systematic barriers to homeownership for people of color. Nationally, WORTH aims to help create 40,000 new homeowners of color in eight markets by the end of 2025 \\n2022 Annual Report vii ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' \\n \\n \\n •\\t We announced an expansion of our Dream.Plan.Home closing \\ncost credit, which provides borrowers with an income at or \\nbelow 80% of the area median income where the property is \\nlocated up to $5,000 to use toward closing costs. The credit is \\navailable in 16 states and in Washington, DC. \\n•\\t We announced Growing Diverse Housing Developers, a \\n$40 million grant initiative focused on expanding the growth \\nand success of real estate developers of color, including Black- \\nand Latino-owned firms. \\nBanking inclusion \\n•\\t As part of our Banking Inclusion Initiative, we launched our \\nfirst Community Connections Branch outside Atlanta, with \\nmore to come. These branches offer spaces for financial \\nhealth seminars and individual consultations. \\n•\\t Also as part of our Banking Inclusion Initiative, we announced \\nplans with Operation HOPE to introduce HOPE Inside centers \\nin 20 markets. HOPE Inside Centers feature financial coaches \\nwho will help empower community members to achieve their \\nfinancial goals through financial education and free \\none-on-one coaching. To date, we’ve launched these centers \\nin the Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Oakland and Phoenix \\nmetro regions. \\n•\\t Since its launch in 2022, our Small Business Resource \\nNavigator has connected nearly 1,300 small businesses to \\npotential credit opportunities and technical assistance \\nservices provided by CDFIs. \\nClimate initiatives \\n•\\t We announced interim greenhouse gas reduction targets for \\nthe Oil & Gas and Power sectors. \\n•\\t We issued our second Inclusive Communities and Climate \\nBond, a $2 billion bond that will finance projects and \\nprograms supporting housing affordability, economic \\nopportunity, renewable energy and clean transportation. \\nIn addition, we have made significant progress on our Diversity, \\nEquity and Inclusion initiatives. These are detailed in our first \\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion annual report, which we \\npublished last summer. We continue to push forward on our \\ncommitment to integrating DE&I across the company, and, as \\npart of this commitment, we have commissioned an external, \\nthird-party Racial Equity Assessment. We plan to publish the \\nresults of the assessment by the end of this year. \\nI’m proud of all this work. We are balanced in our approach to \\nenvironmental, social and governance issues, and, as I wrote a \\nyear ago, we believe that for us to be successful as a company, \\nwe must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions \\nand actions, beyond shareholders. This is not in lieu of \\nshareholders – in fact we believe it will enhance our returns to \\nshareholders over time. Our history has shown this to be true. \\nConsumers and businesses want to do business with a company \\nthat has a strong reputation. A strong reputation is achieved not just from strong financial performance, but from actively \\nsupporting employees, customers, and communities – especially \\nthose most in need. \\nAs we look forward \\nI remain confident in our company. The franchise we have is \\nenviable and will become increasingly more so as we transform \\nthe company. We have done much and we must finish the risk \\nand control work I’ve described in a timeframe and with the \\nquality to satisfy our regulators to take advantage of the \\nopportunities in front of us, so this will remain our top priority. \\nWe will do this while we navigate what will likely be a tricky \\neconomic environment. 2022 was a turning point in the cycle \\nand the impact of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases \\nhave not been fully seen in the economy yet. Though we are \\nstarting to see the impact on consumer spend, credit, housing, \\nand demands for goods and services, it is still early. Thus far, the \\nimpact to consumers and businesses has been manageable. \\nThough there will certainly be some industries and segments of \\nconsumers that are more impacted than others, the rate of \\nimpact we see in our customer base is not materially \\naccelerating. This plus the strength with which consumers and \\nbusinesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of \\nfacts as we look forward. \\nWhile we are not predicting a severe downturn, we must be \\nprepared for one and we are a stronger company today than 1 \\nand 2 years ago. We have actively managed our capital position \\nand focused on efficiency. Our margins are wider, our returns are \\nhigher, we are better managed, and our capital position is \\nstrong. While we will be impacted by a downturn in the \\neconomic cycle, we feel prepared for a downside scenario if \\nwe see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict. \\nWe still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as \\nwe make progress on our efficiency initiatives. We will invest as \\nnecessary in our risk and control infrastructure, we will \\nmodernize our existing platforms, and we will continue to make \\nthe investments necessary serve our customers through service, \\ntechnology and product enhancements. \\nI want to conclude by thanking our employees across the \\ncompany who are working hard each day to continue to make \\nprogress on our transformation. The pressure they feel to \\naccomplish our work is immense and the dedication that I see is \\nunmatched. I’m thankful for all that they do and remain \\ncommitted to leading us towards the goal of being the most \\nrespected financial institution in the country. \\nI’m excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead. \\nCharles W.

Wells Fargo ranked No. 41 on        Fortune’s \\xa02022  \\nrankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth i         n  \\nassets and third in the market value of our common stock among             \\nall U.S. banks at     December 31, 2022 \\xa0  . \\xa0\\nWells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control           \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The         \\nCompany is subject to a number of consent orders and other            \\nregulatory actions, which may require the Company, among         \\nother things, to undertake certain changes to its business,          \\noperations, products and services, and risk management        \\npractices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to         \\ntake multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or            \\ndelays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues o          r  \\ndelays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on           \\nothers, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulator          y  \\naction on a timely basis could result in additional penalties,           \\nbusiness restrictions, enforcement actions, and other negative        \\nconsequences, which could be significant. While we still have          \\nsignificant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspec           ts  \\nof these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to          \\ndevoting the resources necessary to operate with strong         \\nbusiness practices and controls, maintain the highest level of          \\nintegrity, and have an appropriate culture in place.        \\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management \\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would terminate. \\nConsent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation Activities \\nOn September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party \\nWells Fargo & Company 2 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",

The required actions related to many of these matters were already substantially complete at the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent order lays out a path to termination after the Company completes the remainder of the required actions. \\nRetail Sales Practices Matters \\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers received products and services they did not request. As a result, it remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive action plan that includes making things right for our customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. \\nFor additional information regarding retail sales practices \\nmatters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nCustomer Remediation Activities \\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and implement additional operational and control procedures. We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. \\nWe have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \\nrelated to our customer remediation activities, which amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. \\nFor additional information regarding accruals for customer \\nremediation, see the “Expenses” section in Note 20 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional information regarding these activities, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. Recent Developments \\nLIBOR Transition The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. \\nIn first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) \\nAct (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in U.S. law contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act on December 16, 2022, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. We expect that the LIBOR Act will transition certain of our legacy USD LIBOR contracts that do not have appropriate fallback provisions to the applicable SOFR-based replacement rates specified in the FRB’s final rule. \\nWe no longer offer new contracts referencing LIBOR, subject \\nto limited exceptions based on regulatory guidance. During 2022, we executed certain LIBOR transition activities to enhance our operational readiness such as the development of new alternative reference rate products, model and system updates, and employee training. \\nFor certain contracts, including commercial credit facilities \\nand related derivatives, we continue to proactively engage with our clients and contract parties to replace LIBOR with SOFR-based rates or other alternative reference rates in advance of the June 30, 2023 cessation date. \\nFollowing June 30, 2023, we expect substantially all of our \\nconsumer loans, commercial credit facilities, debt securities, derivatives, and long-term debt indexed to USD LIBOR to transition to SOFR-based or other alternative reference rates in accordance with existing fallback provisions or the LIBOR Act. \\nFor additional information regarding the risks and potential \\nimpact of LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, see the “Risk Factors” section in this Report. \\nWells Fargo & Company 3 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

Total equity of $181.9 billion at December 31, 2022, decreased compared with $190.1 billion at December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to net unrealized losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities.

Net income decreased in 2022, compared with 2021, due to a $13.9 billion decrease in noninterest income, a $5.7 billion increase in provision for credit losses, and a $3.5 billion increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $9.2 billion increase in net interest income, a $3.5 billion decrease in income tax expense, and a $2.0 billion decrease in net income from noncontrolling interests. \\nFor a discussion of our 2021 financial results, compared with \\n2020, see the “Earnings Performance” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. \\nNet Interest Income \\nNet interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. \\nNet interest income and the net interest margin in any one \\nperiod can be significantly affected by a variety of factors including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from period to period. Net interest income and net interest margin increased in \\n2022, compared with 2021, due to the impact of higher interest rates on earning assets, higher loan balances, and lower mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization, partially offset by lower interest income from Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and loans purchased from Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan securitization pools, and higher expenses for interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt . \\nTable 3 presents the individual components of net interest \\nincome and net interest margin.

All other business        activities that are not included in the reportable operating          segments have been included in Corporate. For additional         information, see   Table 8  . We define our reportable operating       segments by type of product and customer segment, and their           results are based on our management reporting process. The          management reporting process measures the performance of        the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s         management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed         with our Chief Executive     Officer  and relevant senior    \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on         U.S.  GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds         transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenu       e  and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to       consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt        sources, which allows management to assess performance        consistently across the operating segments.     \\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nRevenue and Expense Sharing When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. \\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results. \\nAllocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that \\nreturn on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess a reportable operating segment’s use of capital. \\nSelected Metrics We present certain financial and nonfinancial metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable operating segment results. Management believes that these metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable operating segments or lines of business. \\nTable 8: Management Reporting Structure \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nConsumer  \\nBanking a  nd \\nLending \\n• Consumer and \\nSmall Business \\nBanking \\n• Home Lending \\n• Credit Card \\n• Auto \\n•  Personal Lending Commercial  \\nBanking \\n• Middle Market \\nBanking \\n• Asset-Based \\nLending and Leasing Corporate a  nd \\nInvestment  \\nBanking \\n• Banking \\n• Commercial Real \\nEstate \\n• Markets Wealth a  nd  \\nInvestment  \\nManagement \\n• Wells Fargo \\nAdvisors \\n• The Private \\nBank Corporate \\n• Corporate \\nTreasury \\n• Enterprise \\nFunctions \\n• Investment \\nPortfolio \\n• Affiliated venture \\ncapital and private \\nequity businesses \\n• Non-strategic \\nbusinesses \\nWells Fargo & Company 12 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

The average age of our rail cars is 22 years and the rail cars are typically leased to customers under short-term leases of 3 to 5 years. Our three largest concentrations, which represented 55% of our rail car fleet as of December 31, 2022, were rail cars used for the transportation of agricultural grain, coal, and cement/sand products. Impairment may result in the future based on changing economic and market conditions affecting the long-term demand and utility of specific types of rail cars. Our assumptions for impairment are sensitive to estimated utilization and rental rates as well as the estimated economic life of the leased asset. For additional information on the accounting for impairment of operating lease assets, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 8 (Leasing Activity) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWells Fargo & Company 23 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

The size and composition of our AFS and HTM debt securities is dependent upon the Company’s liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives. The AFS debt securities portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise in the normal course of business or due to market stress. Changes in our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes in overall economic or market conditions, which could influence loan origination demand, prepayment rates, or deposit balances and mix. In response, the AFS debt securities portfolio can be rebalanced to meet the Company’s interest rate risk management objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives, the AFS and HTM debt securities portfolios may provide yield enhancement over other short-term assets. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report for additional information on liquidity and interest rate risk. \\nThe AFS debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of \\nliquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions and highly rated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). \\nThe HTM debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of \\nliquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions and highly rated CLOs. Debt securities are classified as HTM at the time of purchase or when transferred from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Our intent is to hold these securities to maturity and collect the contractual cash flows. In January 2023, we changed our intent with respect to HTM debt securities with an amortized cost of $23.9 billion and reclassified them to AFS in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard. For additional information, see the “Current Accounting Developments” section in this Report. The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of \\nAFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 2021. Purchases of AFS and HTM debt securities were more than offset by portfolio runoff and AFS debt security sales. In addition, we transferred AFS debt securities with a fair value of $50.1 billion to HTM debt securities in 2022 due to actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital management purposes. Debt securities transferred from AFS to HTM in 2022 had $4.5 billion of pre-tax unrealized losses at the time of the transfers. \\nThe total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt \\nsecurities at December 31, 2022, were driven by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. \\nAt  December 31, 2022 \\xa0  ,  99% of the combined AFS and HTM        \\ndebt securities portfolio was rated AA-       or above. Ratings are     \\nbased on external ratings where available and, where not          \\navailable, based on internal credit grades.

Our off-balance sheet arrangements include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase debt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. \\nUnfunded Credit Commitments \\nUnfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because these commitments may expire without being used or may be cancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Entities \\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with securitization transactions and are considered variable interest entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. Guarantees and Other Arrangements \\nGuarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar arrangements. For additional information, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nCommitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities \\nWe enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional information, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nDerivatives \\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The notional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWells Fargo & Company 27 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 36}),\n",

Risk is the possibility of an \\nevent occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability \\nto achieve its strategic or business objectives. The Company routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, such as operational risk, which includes compliance and model risks, and strategic and reputation risks. \\nRisk Profile. The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the \\naggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and \\nbusiness activities after taking into consideration risk management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. \\nRisk Capacity. Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that \\nthe Company could assume given its current level of resources \\nbefore triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital and liquidity needs. \\nRisk Appetite. Risk appetite is the amount of risk, within its risk \\ncapacity, the Company is comfortable taking given its current \\nlevel of resources. Risk appetite is articulated in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The Company’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps guide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews reports which include risk appetite information and analysis. \\nRisk and Strategy. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the \\nCompany’s strategic planning process, which identifies the \\nCompany’s most significant opportunities and challenges, develops options to address them, and evaluates the risks and trade-offs of each. The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are considered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with the Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, enterprise functions, and aggregate Company level. After review, the strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s evaluation. \\nRisk and Climate Change. The Company is committed to helping \\nmitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities \\nand to partner with key stakeholders, including communities and customers, to do the same. The Company expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. Risk is Managed by Everyone. Every employee, in the course of \\ntheir daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining the Company’s control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \\nRisk and Culture. Senior management sets the tone at the top \\nby supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \\nexpectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board oversees senior management in establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to the Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing credible challenge to the Company’s performance management and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations. \\nRisk Management Framework. The Company’s risk \\nmanagement framework sets forth the Company’s core \\nprinciples for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. \\nWells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by \\nbuilding an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We continue to enhance and mature our risk management programs, including operational and compliance risk management programs as required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s April 20, 2018, consent orders. \\nRisk Governance \\nRole of the Board. The Board oversees the Company’s business, \\nincluding its risk management. It assesses senior management’s performance and holds senior management accountable for maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management program. \\nBoard Committee Structure. The Board carries out its risk \\noversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. \\nThe Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk management framework and oversees management’s implementation of the framework, including how the Company manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk Committee supports the stature, authority and independence of IRM and oversees and receives reports on its operation. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports functionally to the Risk Committee and administratively to the CEO. \\nWells Fargo & Company 28 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 37}),\n",

The Company has \\nestablished management committees, including those focused \\non risk, that support management in carrying out its governance and risk management responsibilities. One type of management committee is a governance committee, which is a decision-making body that operates for a particular purpose and may report to a Board committee. \\nEach management governance committee, in accordance \\nwith its charter, is expected to discuss, document, and make decisions regarding high priority and significant risks, emerging risks, risk acceptances, and risks and issues escalated to it; review and monitor progress related to critical and high-risk issues and remediation efforts, including lessons learned; and report key challenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues as appropriate. \\nTable 15 presents, as of December 31, 2022, the structure \\nof the Company’s Board committees and escalation paths of relevant management governance committees reporting to a Board committee. \\nTable 15: Board and Relevant Management-level Governance Committee Structure \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nAudit \\nCommittee  (1) \\nDisclosure \\nCommittee \\nRegu\\nlatory \\nReporting \\nOversight \\nCommittee Finance \\nCommittee \\nCapital \\nManagement \\nCommittee \\nCor\\nporate \\nAsset/Liability \\nCommittee \\nRecovery & \\nResolution \\nCommittee Corporate\\nResponsibility\\nCommittee Risk \\nCommittee \\nManagement G  overnance Committees  \\nAllowance for Credit \\nLosses Approval \\nGovernance \\nCommittee Governance & \\nNominating\\nCommittee \\nEnter\\nprise Risk   &  \\nControl C  ommittee \\nRisk & Control \\nCommittees \\nRisk Type \\nCommittees \\nRisk Topic \\nCommittees Human \\nResources \\nCommittee \\nIncentive \\nCompensation \\n& Performance \\nManagement \\nCommittee \\n(1) The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s financial statements and disclosures to shareholders and regulatory agencies; oversees the internal audit function and external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and assists the Board and the Risk Committee in the oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. \\nManagement Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk Committee of the Board. The Enterprise Risk & Control \\nCommittee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management program. \\nThe ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, and its \\nmembership is comprised of principal line of business and certain enterprise function heads. The Chief Auditor or a designee attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also has an escalation path for certain human capital risks and issues to the Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate anything directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC in accordance with the Company’s escalation management policy. \\nEach principal line of business and enterprise function has a \\nrisk and control committee, which is a management governance committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its scope limited to the respective principal line of business or enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider risks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise function generate and manage, and the controls the principal line of business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. \\nAs a complement to these risk and control committees, \\nmanagement governance committees dedicated to specific risk types and risk topics also report to the ERCC to enable more comprehensive governance of risks. \\nRisk Operating Model – Roles and Responsibilities \\nThe Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the Front Line, Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. •\\t\\t Front Line The Front Line, which comprises principal line of \\nbusiness and certain enterprise function activities, is the first line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its business activities. The Front Line identifies, measures and assesses, controls, monitors, and reports on risk generated by or associated with its business activities and balances risk and reward in decision making while operating within the Company’s risk appetite. \\n•\\t\\t Independent Risk Management IRM is the second line of \\ndefense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk management program and provides oversight, including \\nWells Fargo & Company 29 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 38}),\n",

It is \\nresponsible for acting as an independent assurance function \\nand validates that the risk management program is adequately designed and functioning effectively. \\nRisk Type Classifications \\nThe Company uses common classifications, hierarchies, and ratings to enable consistency across risk management programs and aggregation of information. Risk type classifications permit the Company to identify and prioritize its risk exposures, including emerging risk exposures. \\nOperational Risk Management \\nOperational risk, which in addition to those discussed in this section, includes compliance risk and model risk, is the risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. \\nThe Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for all aspects of operational risk, including significant supporting programs and/or policies regarding the Company’s business resiliency and disaster recovery, change management, data management, information security, technology, and third-party risk management. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee reviews and approves significant operational risk policies and oversees the Company’s operational risk management program. \\nAt the management level, Operational Risk Management, \\nwhich is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for operational risk. Operational Risk Management reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to operational risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. Operational Risk Management’s oversight responsibilities include change management risk, data management risk, fraud risk, human capital risk, information management risk, information security risk, technology risk, and third-party risk. \\nInformation security is a significant operational risk for \\nfinancial institutions such as Wells Fargo and includes the risk arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information or information systems. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of the Company’s information security risk management and cyber defense programs. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for information security risk and approves the Company’s information security program, which includes the information security policy and the cyber defense program. \\nWells Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as our \\nthird-party service providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security threats. See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional information regarding the risks associated with a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including as a result of cyber attacks. \\nCompliance Risk Management \\nCompliance risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk resulting from the failure to comply with laws (legislation, regulations and rules) and regulatory guidance, and the failure to appropriately address associated impact, including to customers. Compliance risk encompasses violations of applicable internal policies, program requirements, procedures, and standards related to ethical principles applicable to the Company. \\nThe Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for all aspects of compliance risk, including financial crimes risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee reviews and approves significant supporting compliance risk and financial crimes risk policies and programs and oversees the Company’s compliance risk management and financial crimes risk management programs. \\nConduct risk, a sub-category of compliance risk, is the risk of \\ninappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior on the part of employees or individuals acting on behalf of the Company, caused by deliberate or unintentional actions or business practices. In connection with its oversight of conduct risk, the Board oversees the alignment of employee conduct to the Company’s risk appetite (which the Board approves annually). The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for conduct risk and risk management components of the Company’s culture, while the responsibilities of the Board’s Human Resources Committee include oversight of the Company’s culture, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, human capital management (including talent management and succession planning), performance management program, and incentive compensation risk management program. \\nAt the management level, the Compliance function, which is \\npart of IRM, monitors the implementation of the Company’s compliance and conduct risk programs. Financial Crimes Risk Management, which is part of the Compliance function, oversees and monitors financial crimes risk. The Compliance function reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to compliance risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. \\nModel Risk Management \\nModel risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk arising from the potential for adverse consequences of decisions made based on model output that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. \\nThe Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for model risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee oversees the Company’s model risk management policy, model governance, model performance, model issue remediation status, and adherence to model risk appetite metrics. \\nAt the management level, the Model Risk function, which is \\npart of IRM, has oversight responsibility for model risk and is responsible for governance, validation and monitoring of model risk across the Company. The Model Risk function reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to model risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. \\nWells Fargo & Company 30 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",

Management develops, executes and recommends significant strategic corporate transactions and the Board evaluates management’s proposals, including their impact on the Company’s risk profile and financial position. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for the Company’s strategic risk and the adequacy of the Company’s strategic risk management program, including associated risk management practices, processes and controls. The Board’s Risk Committee also receives updates from management regarding new business initiatives activity and risks related to new or changing products, as appropriate. \\nAt the management level, the Strategic Risk Oversight \\nfunction, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Oversight function reports into the CRO and supports periodic reports related to strategic risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. \\nReputation Risk Management \\nReputation risk is the risk arising from the potential that negative stakeholder opinion or negative publicity regarding the Company’s business practices, whether true or not, will adversely impact current or projected financial conditions and resilience, cause a decline in the customer base, or result in costly litigation. Key stakeholders include customers, employees, communities, shareholders, regulators, elected officials, advocacy groups, and media organizations. \\nThe Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for reputation risk, while each Board committee has reputation risk oversight responsibilities related to their primary oversight responsibilities. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee receives reports from management that help it monitor how effectively the Company is managing reputation risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities for social and public responsibility matters, the Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee receives reports from management relating to stakeholder perceptions of the Company. \\nAt the management level, the Reputation Risk Oversight \\nfunction, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for reputation risk. The Reputation Risk Oversight function reports into the CRO and supports periodic reports related to reputation risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. \\nCredit Risk Management \\nWe define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many of the Company’s assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, certain derivatives, and loans. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of credit risk. At the management level, Corporate Credit Risk, which is part of Independent Risk Management, has oversight responsibility for credit risk. Corporate Credit Risk reports to the CRO and supports periodic reports related to credit risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit Subcommittee. \\nLoan Portfolio Our loan portfolios represent the largest \\ncomponent of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which \\nwe have credit risk.

We employ various credit risk management and monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple risk factors affecting loans we hold including: • Loan concentrations and related credit quality; \\n• Counterparty credit risk; \\n• Economic and market conditions; \\n• Legislative or regulatory mandates; \\n• Changes in interest rates; \\n• Merger and acquisition activities; and \\n• Reputation risk. \\nIn addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its credit risk management activities. \\nOur credit risk management oversight process is governed \\ncentrally, but provides for direct management and accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit process. \\nA key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-\\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. \\nWells Fargo & Company 31 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n",

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING \\nFor purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate \\ncommercial and industrial loans and lease financing according to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease financing to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss categories. \\nWe had $12.6 billion of the commercial and industrial loans \\nand lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at \\nDecember 31, 2022, \\ncompared with $13.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The decline was driven by decreases in the technology, telecom and media, real estate and construction, and oil, gas and pipelines industries, as these industries continued to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in the materials and commodities, and equipment, machinery and parts manufacturing industries. \\nThe majority of our commercial and industrial loans and \\nlease financing portfolio is secured \\nby short-term assets, such as \\naccounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of repayment. \\nThe portfolio increased at December 31, 2022, compared \\nwith \\nDecember 31, 2021, driven by higher loan demand resulting \\nin increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns. Table 18 provides our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry.

Our evaluation is based on the most current financial information available and is focused on various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us based on our analysis as well as other lenders’ experience with the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance for credit losses methodology. \\nIn considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate \\nthe collateral and future cash flows as well as the anticipated support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. \\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE) Our CRE loan portfolio is \\ncomprised of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had $11.3 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at December 31, 2022, compared with $13.1 billion at December 31, 2021, and $1.1 billion of CRE construction loans classified as criticized at December 31, 2022, compared with $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in criticized CRE loans was driven by the hotel/motel and shopping center property types, as these property types continued to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in the office buildings and apartment property types. Criticized CRE loans at December 31, 2022, increased compared with September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the office buildings property type. The credit quality of the office buildings property type could continue to be adversely affected if weakened demand for office space continues to drive higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance. At December 31, 2022, nearly one-third of the CRE loans in the office buildings property type had recourse to a guarantor, typically through a repayment guarantee, in addition to the related collateral. The total CRE loan portfolio increased $8.0 billion from \\nDecember 31, 2021, predominantly driven by an increase in loans for apartments and industrial/warehouse property types, partially offset by a decrease in loans for the shopping center property type. The CRE loan portfolio included $7.6 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans at December 31, 2022, down from $8.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Texas, and Florida, which represented a combined 49% of the total CRE portfolio. The largest property type concentrations are apartments at 26% and office buildings at 23% of the portfolio. The unfunded credit commitments were $8.8 billion and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for CRE mortgage loans and $20.7 billion and $20.0 billion, respectively, for CRE construction loans. \\nWells Fargo & Company 34 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 43}),\n",

At December 31, 2022, non-U.S. loans totaled $87.5 billion, representing approximately 9% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $86.9 billion, or approximately 10% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2021. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 5% and 4% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nCOUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE Our country risk monitoring process \\nincorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure limits for each country through a centralized oversight process based on customer needs, and through consideration of the relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the reporting based on the borrower’s primary address. \\nOur largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at \\nDecember 31, 2022\\n, was the United Kingdom, which totaled \\n$33.2 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and included $5.5 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom sovereign claims arise from deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support of our London branch. \\nTable 20 provides information regarding our top 20 \\nexposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of any guarantors and/or underlying collateral.

Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 95% of the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2022, compared with 94% at December 31, 2021. \\nThe residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with \\nadjustable-rate features. We monitor t\\nhe risk of default as a \\nresult of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. ARM loans were 7% of total loans at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for the majority of this portfolio at December 31, 2022. We do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. \\nThe residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of \\nresidential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar features. Junior lien loan products are \\nprimarily amortizing \\npayment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan is delinquent. \\nThe outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of \\ncredit was \\n$18.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The unfunded \\ncredit commitments for these lines of credit totaled $35.5 billion at December 31, 2022. Our residential mortgage lines of credit (both first and junior lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2022\\n, a significant portion of the lines of credit in \\na draw period used the interest-only option. The lines that enter their amortization period may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this increased risk in our ACL for loans estimate. Interest-only lines and loans were approximately 2% and 3% of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nDuring the draw period, the borrower has the option of \\nconverting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance. \\nIn anticipation of our residential mortgage line of credit \\nborrowers reaching the end of their draw period, we have created a program to inform, educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. \\nWells Fargo & Company 36 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 45}),\n",

Our periodic review of this portfolio includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate the market value of homes. We have processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the circumstances when AVMs may be used. For additional information about our use of appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nPart of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, \\ncurrent FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values (LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit line products) to property collateral value. For additional information regarding credit quality indicators, see \\nNote 5 (Loans \\nand Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist \\nhomeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Under these programs, we may provide concessions such as interest rate reductions, forbearance of principal, and in some cases, principal forgiveness. These programs generally include trial payment periods of three to four months, and after successful completion and compliance with terms during this period, the loan is permanently modified. Loans included under these programs are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) at the start of the trial period or at the time of permanent modification, if no trial period is used. Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of delinquencies.

TDRs decreased from December 31, 2021, predominantly driven by a decrease in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase in trial modifications. The decrease in residential mortgage loans was due to paydowns and transfers to LHFS, which related to loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. In January 2023, we adopted a new accounting standard that eliminates the accounting and reporting guidance for TDRs. For additional information, see the “Current Accounting Developments” section in this Report. \\nThe amount of our TDRs at December 31, 2022, would have \\notherwise been higher without the TDR relief provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and the \\nInteragency Statement on Loan Modifications and \\nReporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (Interagency Statement). \\nCustomers who are unable to resume making their contractual loan payments upon exiting from these deferral programs may require further assistance and may receive or be eligible to receive modifications, which may be classified as TDRs.

We may re-underwrite loans at the time of restructuring to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s documented income, debt to income ratios, and other factors. Loans that are not re-underwritten or loans that lack sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity at the time of modification are charged down to the fair value of the collateral, if applicable. For an accruing loan that has been modified, if the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing status. Otherwise, the loan will be placed in nonaccrual status and may be returned to accruing status when the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to modification. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status, and a corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan balance, when we believe that principal and interest contractually due under the modified agreement will not be collectible.

Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish          \\nour ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for \\n           \\nloans takes into consideration many factors, including historic        al  \\nand forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings a         nd  \\nloan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves       \\nsubjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a          variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and           trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the           allowance as we use several analytical tools.

The entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date of determination, including economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES We sell residential and \\ncommercial mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) government-sponsored entities (GSEs), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), who include the mortgage loans in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. \\nIn connection with our sales and securitization of residential \\nmortgage loans, we have established a mortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to various representations and warranties that reflect management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of factors. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. \\nWe provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage \\nloans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms of these programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of actual losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our exposure to loss related to these programs. \\nIn addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as \\nservicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. \\nThe loans we service were originated by us or by other \\nmortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. \\nIn accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon \\ntransfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these repurchased loan balances were $9.8 billion and $17.3 billion, respectively, which included $8.6 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in loans held for sale. \\nRepurchased loans that regain current status or are \\notherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This requirement may delay our ability to transfer loans into the securitization market. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our involvement with mortgage loan securitizations. \\nEach agreement under which we act as servicer or master \\nservicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period. The standards governing servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention and assistance, and can result in business restrictions or the imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. For example, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. For additional information on certain consent orders applicable to the Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. \\nWells Fargo & Company 45 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n",

Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides with the Finance Committee of the Board, which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial risk management policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk Committee of the Board. \\nAt the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability \\nCommittee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and supports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate management level oversight specific to market risk. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that market \\nfluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the Company’s asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending and deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: •\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tassets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different \\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; \\n•\\tassets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts; \\n•\\tshort-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently; \\n•\\tthe remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, mortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or \\n•\\tinterest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under \\nvarious net interest income simulations using many interest rate \\nscenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change over time, the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. \\nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 32, \\nestimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors three years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in \\nTable 32: \\n•\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tSimulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities. \\n• Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant. •\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tMortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \\nacross scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates. \\n• Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the alternative scenarios. In \\nhigher interest rate scenarios, \\ncustomer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding products could impact expected net interest income. \\n• The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the expectations of deposit products repricing as market interest rates change (referred to as deposit betas). Our actual experience in base and alternative scenarios may differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors. \\n• We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities portfolios constant across scenarios. \\nTable 32:    Net Interest Inco   me S ensitivity Over the Next 12 Mo      nths  \\nUsing Insta  ntaneous Mo  vements  \\n  ($ in billions)\\t\\t   Dec 31, 2022   Dec 31, 2021 \\n Parallel shift:\\n\\t\\n     +100 bps shift in interest rates $  2.3  7.1\\n     -100 bps shift in interest rates (1.7) (3.3)\\n   Steeper yield curve: (1)\\n \\t\\n      +100 bps shift in long-term interest rates 0.8 n/a\\n      -100 bps shift in short-term interest rates (1.0) n/a\\n      +50 bps shift in long-term interest rates 0.4 1.2\\n      -50 bps shift in short-term interest rates (0.5) (0.9)\\n    (1)\\n Flatter yield curve: \\t\\n      +100 bps shift in short-term interest rates  1.5 n/a\\n      -100 bps shift in long-term interest rates (0.7) n/a\\n      +50 bps shift in short-term interest rates  0.7 2.6\\n      -50 bps shift in long-term interest rates (0.4) (1.0)\\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n(1)\\t\\t In fourth quarter 2022, given the higher levels of interest rates and volatility, we presented 100 b\\nps shifts in our steeper and flatter scenarios. \\nThe changes in our interest rate sensitivity from \\nDecember 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022, in Table 32 reflected updates to our base scenario, including expectations for balance sheet composition and interest rates. Our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. For the December 31, 2021, simulations with downward shifts in interest rates, the 0.00% interest rate floor limited the amount of the decline in net interest income. \\nThe sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest \\nincome or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are impacted by mortgage banking activities that may have sensitivity impacts that move in the opposite direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section \\nin this Report for \\nadditional information. \\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted \\nby changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees \\nWells Fargo & Company 46 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",

In addition, the impact to net interest income does not include the fair value changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In addition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and noninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by the actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded \\nand over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers the amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt securities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized into earnings over the life of the security with no further impact from interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: \\n•\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tto convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability \\ninstruments/portfolios including investments, commercial loans and long-term debt, from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa; and \\n• to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. \\nIn 2022, we entered into interest rate swap hedges to \\nreduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities portfolio. Additionally, we entered into interest rate swaps to convert the interest cash flows of some floating-rate assets, such as commercial loans and certain interest-earning deposits with banks, to fixed-rates. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures are presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We \\noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \\nChanges in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \\nnoninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer demand, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest rates. \\nThe valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly \\nsubjective and involve complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently unpredictable. Changes in interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions captured in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including prepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow balances and other servicing valuation elements. See the “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional information on the valuation of our residential MSRs. \\nAn increase in interest rates generally reduces the \\npropensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the servicing portfolio, and therefore increases the estimated fair value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. \\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our \\nresidential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income being hedged. \\nThe size of the hedge and the particular combination of \\nhedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a range of mortgage interest rates. Market factors, the composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio, and the relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our mortgage businesses change continually, and therefore the types of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. \\nFor additional information on mortgage banking, including \\nkey assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nMARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \\nfrom adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge effectiveness risk associated with mortgage loans held at fair value, and impairment of private equity investments. \\nThe Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight responsibilities with respect to market risk, including counterparty risk. The Finance Committee reports key market risk matters to the Risk Committee. \\nAt the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk \\nManagement function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for market risk across the enterprise.

These trading activities predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser extent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading activities include net interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest expense components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For additional information on the financial instruments used in our trading activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to \\nestimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management function aggregates and monitors exposures against our established risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors various market risk exposure measures from a variety of perspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and legal entity. \\nTrading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \\nmarket risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nTable 33 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk \\ncategory. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation model which assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the potential future outcomes and measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a 1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a 12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a 12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on average once every 100 trading days. \\nAverage Company Trading General VaR was $35 million for \\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $49 million \\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in average Company Trading General VaR for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition. \\nTable 33: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category \\n   Year ended December 31, \\n2022 2021 \\n (in millions) Period \\nend Average Low High Period \\nend Average Low High \\n     Company Trading General VaR Risk Categories \\nCredit  $ 29 32 19 85 19 38 12 112\\n Interest rate 25 25 9 88 15 25 4 120\\nEquity 27 23 13 38 15 30 13 72\\nCommodity 4 6 2 20 10 7 2 28\\n Foreign exchange 1 1 0 2 1 1 0 1\\n  Diversification benefit (1)  (47) (52)  (40) (52)\\n   Company Trading General VaR  $ 39  35 20 49        \\n                    \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n(1) The p  eriod-end  VaR wa  s less t   han t  he su  m  of t  he Va  R com  ponents d  escribed  above,  which  is d  ue t  o p  ortfolio d  iversification.

The d  iversification b  enefit  is not   meaningful for   low a  nd  high  metrics since t   hey  may  occur  on d  ifferent  days. \\nSensitivity Analysis Given the inherent limitations of the VaR models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves. \\nStress Testing While VaR captures the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, stress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These scenarios assume that the market moves happen instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). \\nAn inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both \\nhistorical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress \\nWells Fargo & Company 48 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",

Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in this Report. \\nMARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly \\naffected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments. These private equity investments are made within capital allocations approved by management and the Board. The Board reviews business developments, key risks and historical returns for the private equity investment portfolio at least annually. Management reviews these investments at least quarterly to assess them for impairment and observable price changes. For nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of each individual investment and the expectations for that investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the viability of its business model, our exit strategy, and observable price changes that are similar to the investments held. Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair value through net income, and the measurement alternative. \\nAs part of our business to support our customers, we trade \\npublic equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also have marketable equity securities that include investments relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 4 (Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nChanges in equity market prices may also indirectly affect \\nour net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and other business activities. Each business line monitors and manages these indirect risks. \\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING Liquidity risk is the risk arising from \\nthe inability of the Company to meet obligations when they come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, leases for premises and equipment, and other cash commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or market stress. For additional information on these obligations, see the following sections and Notes to Financial Statements in this Report: •\\t\\t “Unfunded Credit Commitments” section within Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses (Note 5) \\n•\\t\\t Leasing Activity (Note 8) \\n•\\t\\t Deposits (Note 9) \\n•\\t\\t Long-Term Debt (Note 10) \\n•\\t\\t Guarantees and Other Commitments (Note 17) \\n•\\t\\t Employee Benefits (Note 21) \\n•\\t\\t Income Taxes (Note 22) \\nTo help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidit         y  \\nguidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cov        er  potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence        on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines ar         e  monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate ALCO and on a             quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are established          and  monitored for both the Company and the Parent on a stand           -alone basis so that the Parent is a source of strength for its              banking subsidiaries.  \\nLiquidity Stress Tests Liquidity stress tests are performed to help ensure that the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet contractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of stress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as corporate-specific events, including a range of stress conditions and time horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of the Company’s projected liquidity position during stress and inform future needs in the Company’s funding plan. \\nContingency Funding Plan Our contingency funding plan (CFP), which is approved by Corporate ALCO and the Board’s Risk Committee, sets out the Company’s strategies and action plans to address potential liquidity needs during market-wide or idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP establishes measures for monitoring emerging liquidity events and describes the processes for communicating and managing stress events should they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate funding and liquidity strategies available to the Company in a period of stress. \\nLiquidity Standards We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies to the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as Wells Fargo. \\nThe FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing \\na stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term debt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with total assets of $10 billion or more. As of December 31, 2022, we were compliant with the NSFR requirement. \\nWells Fargo & Company 49 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 58}),\n",

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of \\nrelatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 145% and 166% of total \\nloans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately \\n$209.0 billion of available borrowing capacity at various Federal \\nHome Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. \\nAlthough available, we do not view the borrowing capacity at the \\nFederal Reserve Discount Window as a primary source of \\nliquidity. Table 36 presents a summary of our short-term \\nborrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. For \\nadditional information on the classification of our short-term \\nborrowings, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting \\nPolicies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. \\nThere were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies \\nwith regard to our credit ratings during fourth quarter 2022. See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional \\ninformation regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and operations as well as \\nNote 14 (Derivatives) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report for information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade. \\nThe credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., \\nas of \\nDecember 31, 2022, are presented in Table 38. \\nTable 38: Credit Ratings as of December 31, 2022 \\nWells Fargo & Company Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. \\nSenior debt Short-term \\nborrowings Long-term \\ndeposits Short-term \\nborrowings \\nMoody’s A1 P-1 Aa1 P-1 \\nS&P Global Ratings BBB+ A-2 A+ A-1 \\nFitch Ratings A+ F1 AA F1+ \\nDBRS Morningstar AA (low) R-1 (middle) AA R-1 (high) \\nWells Fargo & Company 51 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",

Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the retention of earnings net of both dividends and share repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at December 31, 2022, increased $7.3 billion from December 31, 2021, predominantly as a result of $13.2 billion of Wells Fargo net income, partially offset by $5.4 billion of common and preferred stock dividends. During 2022, we issued $1.8 billion of common stock, substantially all of which was issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. In 2022, we repurchased 110 million shares of common stock at a cost of $6 billion. In 2022, our AOCI decreased $11.7 billion, predominantly due to net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the amount of our risk-based capital. For additional information about capital planning, see the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section below. \\nIn 2022, we redeemed $609 million of preferred stock. For \\nadditional information, see Note 11 (Preferred Stock) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nRegulatory Capital Requirements \\nThe Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. \\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company \\nis subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 39 and Table 40 present the risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Table 39: Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Standardized Approach as of December 31, 2022 \\nStandardized Approach\\n9.20%\\n10.70%\\n12.70%4.50%\\n6.00%\\n8.00%3.20%\\n3.20%\\n3.20%1.50%\\n1.50%\\n1.50%\\nMinimum requirement Stress capital buffer\\nG-SIB capital surchargeCommon Equity Tier 1 \\n(CET1) ratio\\nTier 1 capital ratio\\nTotal capital ratio\\nTable 40: Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Advanced Approach as of December 31, 2022 \\nAdvanced Approach\\n8.50%\\n10.00%\\n12.00%4.50%\\n6.00%\\n8.00%2.50%\\n2.50%\\n2.50%1.50%\\n1.50%\\n1.50%\\nMinimum requirement Capital conservation buffer\\nG-SIB capital surchargeCommon Equity Tier 1 \\n(CET1) ratio\\nTier 1 capital ratio\\nTotal capital ratio\\nIn addition to the risk-based capital requirements described \\nin Table 39 and Table 40, if the FRB determines that a period of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at December 31, 2022, was 0.00%. \\nThe capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain \\ninstitutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or financial stress. \\nWells Fargo & Company 52 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",

Because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, is 3.20%. \\nAs a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also           \\nsubject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital          surcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio         requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually          calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher          of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers           our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity,      substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the       methodology developed by the     BCBS  and the Financial Stability     Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar          inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term         wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2023. \\nUnder the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets \\nand credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). \\nThe tables that follow provide information about our risk-\\nbased capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III capital rules. Table 41 summarizes our CET1, Tier 1 capital, total capital, RWAs and capital ratios. \\nTable 41: Capital Components and Ratios \\nStandardized Approach Advanced Approach \\n($ in millions) Required\\nCapital\\nRatios   (1) Dec 31, \\n2022 Dec 31, \\n2021 Required\\nCapital\\nRatios   (1) Dec 31, \\n2022 Dec 31, \\n2021 \\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (A) $  133,527  140,643 133,527 140,643 \\nTier 1 capital (B) 152,567 159,671 152,567 159,671 \\nTotal capital (C) 186,747 196,281 177,258 186,553 \\nRisk-weighted assets (D) 1,259,889 1,239,026 1,112,307 1,116,068 \\n     Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio (A)/(D)   9.20 %   10.60 *   11.35   8.50   12.00   12.60 \\n   Tier 1 capital ratio (B)/(D)   10.70   12.11 *   12.89   10.00   13.72   14.31 \\n  Total capital ratio (C)/(D)   12.70   14.82 *   15.84   12.00   15.94   16.72 \\n   * Denotes t  he b  inding  ratio u  nder  the S  tandardized  and  Advanced  Approaches a  t  December \\xa031,  2022. \\n(1) Represents t  he m  inimum  ratios r  equired  to a  void  restrictions on ca   pital d  istributions a  nd  discretionary  bonus p  ayments a  t  December \\xa031,  2022. \\nWells Fargo & Company 53 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",

Tangible \\ncommon equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents \\ntotal equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, \\ngoodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) \\nand goodwill and other intangibles on investments in \\nconsolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred \\ntaxes. The ratios are (i) tangible book value per common share, \\nwhich represents tangible common equity divided by common \\nshares outstanding; and (ii) return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a \\npercentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of \\ndetermining tangible common equity may differ among \\ncompanies.

As of December 31, 2022, these broker-dealer \\nsubsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory \\nminimum net capital requirements. \\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing \\nOur planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet          \\nregulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long         -\\nterm targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and gro           w  \\nour business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varyin         g  \\nenvironments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to retur        n  \\ncapital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital         \\nstructure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed ca         pital  \\nrequirements,  including the G-SIB capital surcharge      and the   \\nstress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulato          ry  \\nrequirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions,         \\nchanges in our risk profile and other factors        . Accordingly, our    \\nlong-term target capital levels are set above their respective          \\nregulatory minimums plus buffers.    \\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \\nother requirements that govern capital distributions, including \\ndividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \\nWells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \\nwhen evaluating their capital plans. \\nAs part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and \\nReview, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB \\nreviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the \\nDodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all \\nlarge BHCs and also reviews the Company’s proposed capital \\nactions. \\nFederal banking regulators also require large BHCs and \\nbanks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the \\ninstitution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during \\nperiods of adverse economic and financial conditions. \\nWells Fargo & Company 57 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 66}),\n",

Although we announce when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and any acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any time. \\nAt December 31, 2022, we had remaining Board authority to \\nrepurchase approximately 250 million shares, subject to regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about share repurchases during fourth quarter 2022, see Part II, Item 5 in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nRegulatory Matters \\nThe U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services companies conduct business and may continue to result in increased regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For additional information about the regulatory matters discussed below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, see Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2022 Form 10-K, and the “Overview,” “Capital Management,” “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nDodd-Frank Act \\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s. The following provides additional information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its rulemaking initiatives. \\n•\\t\\t Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important firms. The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress. Furthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs and has proposed related guidance identifying core principles for effective senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may recommend new systemic risk management requirements and require new reporting of systemic risks. \\n•\\t\\t Regulation of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and are protected from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial products, including rules regarding the origination, servicing, notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products and banking-related activities. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of the financial services industry with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto finance. \\n•\\t\\t Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities. The Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps. As a provisionally-registered swap dealer and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, as well as others adopted or under consideration by regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities. \\nRegulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements \\nThe Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. For example, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The Company and its IDIs are also required to maintain specified \\nWells Fargo & Company 58 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",

In addition, the \\nCompany is required to have a minimum amount of total loss absorbing capacity for purposes of resolvability and resiliency. Federal banking regulators have also issued final rules requiring a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. For additional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable to us, see the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” sections in this Report. \\n“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters \\nRules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank            Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo        , to   prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known a         s  “living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly          resolution in the event of material financial distress or failu          re.  Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a          reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the          U.S.  Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable          period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates th           e  risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the           financial stability of the United States. In addition to the           Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary,        Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepar \\xa0          e  and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FD           IC  determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may          impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requiremen        ts  on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until w           e  adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC          ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any           deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets o          r  operations. On November 23, 2022, the FRB and FDIC          announced that the Company’s most recent resolution plan did          not have any shortcomings or deficiencies.       \\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \\nproceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. \\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \\na single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible. \\nTo facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important \\nfinancial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. \\nIn addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and \\nperiodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and \\nWells Fargo & Company 59 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='  \\n   Regulatory Matters (continued)\\n \\nperiodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth            the  \\nBank’s plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is            experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but        has  not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resoluti          on  is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our             recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restriction         s on   our business or ultimately require us to divest assets.         \\nOther Regulatory Related Matters    \\n• Regulatory actions.    The Company is subject to a number of         consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may         require the Company, among other things, to undertake         certain changes to its business, operations, products and         services, and risk management practices, and include the         following: \\n◦ Consent Orders Discussed in the      “Overview”  Section in this    \\nReport.   For a discussion of certain consent orders        applicable to the Company, see the “Overview” section         in this Report.   \\n◦ OCC approval of director and senior executive officer         appointments and certain post-termination payments.       Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC,          Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements \\xa0        that were originally imposed in November 2016 to         provide prior written notice to, and obtain non-        objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in          directors and senior executive officers, and remains        subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-       termination payments to certain individuals and       employees. \\n• Regulatory Developments Related to COVID-19.       In response   to the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal         banking regulators undertook a number of measures to help          stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy,         and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like         Wells Fargo to continue lending to consumers and \\xa0        businesses.  In addition, the OCC and the FRB issued         guidelines for banks and BHCs related to working with          customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including        guidance with respect to waiving fees, offering repayment         accommodations, and providing payment deferrals. Any       current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to          the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts could require us to           change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue          and earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise          adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive        position. • Regulatory Developments in Response to Climate Change.         Federal and state governments and government agencies        have demonstrated increased attention to the impacts and         potential risks associated with climate change. For example,         federal banking regulators are reviewing the implications of         climate change on the financial stability of the United States           and the identification and management by large banks of          climate-related financial risks. In addition, the SEC has         proposed rules that would require public companies to         disclose certain climate-related information, including      greenhouse gas emissions, climate-related targets and       goals, and governance of climate-related risks and relevant         risk management processes. The approaches taken by        various governments and government agencies can vary        significantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. Any         \\ncurrent or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to          climate change and its impacts could require us to change           certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and          earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise         adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive        position. \\nWells Fargo & Company 60 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 69}),\n",

Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern: \\n•\\t\\t the allowance for credit losses; \\n•\\t\\t the valuation of residential MSRs; \\n•\\t\\t the fair value of financial instruments; \\n•\\t\\t income taxes; \\n•\\t\\t liability for contingent litigation losses; and \\n•\\t\\t goodwill impairment. \\nManagement has discussed these critical accounting policies \\nand the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit Committee. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFor loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured \\nbased on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset (including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. \\nChanges in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision \\nfor credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, management considerations include the evaluation of past events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. \\nJudgment is specifically applied in: \\n•\\t\\t Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period. We forecast a wide range of economic variables to estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real estate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses. \\n•\\t\\t Reversion to historical loss expectations. Our long-term average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \\n•\\t\\t Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities. Individually assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default. Borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists. \\n•\\t\\t Usage of credit loss estimation models. We use internally developed models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate credit loss estimates. Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are independently validated in accordance with the Company’s policies. We routinely assess our model performance and apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations against the company-wide risk inventory to help appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as needed. \\n•\\t\\t Valuation of collateral. The current fair value of collateral is utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a negative allowance when the financial asset has been previously written-down below current recovery value. \\n•\\t\\t Contractual term considerations. The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension \\nWells Fargo & Company 61 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 70}),\n",

We also incorporate any scenarios where we         \\nreasonably expect to provide an extension through a         troubled debt restructuring (TDR).     Credit card loans have     \\nindeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine        a contractual life by estimating the application of future          payments to the outstanding loan amount.      \\n•\\t\\t Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \\nSensitivity   The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key           assumptions which requires significant management judgment.       Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety              of  factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quali        ty,  and general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted        economic variables used could have varying impacts on differen         t  financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numero       us  credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variable         s  such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices whic           h  may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in             opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography.         \\nOur sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s \\nview of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We applied a 100% weight to a more severe downside scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic deterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately $7.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. \\nThe sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities \\nand other financial assets given its size relative to the overall ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. \\nValuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) \\nMSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we retain servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset transfers), or purchase servicing rights from third parties. We also have acquired MSRs in the past under co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. \\nWe carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans \\nat fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are reflected in earnings. \\nWe use a model to estimate the fair value of our \\nresidential MSRs. The model is validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. The model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions that market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs and assumptions generally are not observable in the market and require judgment to determine. If observable market indications do become available, these are factored into the estimates as appropriate: \\n•\\t\\t The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future net servicing income. The prepayment rate is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. \\n•\\t\\t The discount rate used to present value estimated future net servicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of return investors in the market would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts). In 2022, we enhanced our approach for estimating the discount rate to a more dynamic methodology for market curves and volatility. \\n•\\t\\t The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net servicing income. The cost to service loans includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market participant’s view for our estimated cost to service and our actual costs may vary from that estimate. \\nBoth prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, \\nand generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in servicing standards as well as changes in individual state foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value estimate to independent appraisals. \\nFor a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, \\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. \\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value \\nadjustments to certain financial instruments and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. For example, assets and liabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, AFS debt securities, derivatives and a majority of our LHFS are carried at fair value each period. Other financial instruments, such as certain LHFS, substantially all nonmarketable equity securities, and loans held for investment, are not carried at fair value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments through the application of an accounting method \\nWells Fargo & Company 62 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 71}),\n",

We also disclose our estimate of fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value, such as HTM debt securities, loans held for investment, and long-term debt. \\nThe accounting requirements for fair value measurements \\ninclude a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. \\nWhen developing fair value measurements, we maximize the \\nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that generally use market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when observable market data is limited or not available, fair value estimates are typically determined using internal models based on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. \\nWhen using internal models based on unobservable inputs, \\nmanagement judgment is necessary as we make judgments about significant assumptions that market participants would use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of many factors, including market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third-party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market participant would require in light of the illiquid market. \\nWe continually assess the level and volume of market \\nactivity in our debt and equity security classes in determining adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions can change over time, our determination of which securities markets are considered active or inactive can change. If we determine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted prices require adjustment, can also change. \\nSignificant judgment is also applied in the determination of \\nwhether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this judgment, we consider available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of unobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant to the fair value measurement, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nTable 51 presents our (1) assets and liabilities recorded at \\nfair value on a recurring basis and (2) Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, both presented as a percentage of our total assets and total liabilities. \\nTable 51:    Fair Va  lue Level 3 S    ummary \\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 \\n($  in  billions) Total  \\nbalance Level 3  (1)  Total  \\nbalance  Level  3   (1) \\nAssets recorded at fair \\nvalue on a recurring \\nbasis $  264.4  11.5 348.9 19.6 \\nAs a percentage \\nof total assets 14 % * 18 1 \\nLiabilities recorded at fair \\nvalue on a recurring basis $  41.7  4.7 30.1 2.6 \\nAs a percentage of \\ntotal liabilities 2 % * 2 * \\n* Less t  han 1%.  \\n(1) Before d  erivative net  ting  adjustments. \\nSee  Note 15   (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities      ) to   \\nFinancial Statements in this Report for a complete discussion o          n  \\nour fair value of financial instruments, our related measuremen         t  techniques and the impact to our financial statements.        \\nIncome Taxes \\nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \\nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \\nmethod and deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. \\nThe income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate \\nare complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise \\nWells Fargo & Company 63 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 72}),\n",

We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions. \\nWe apply judgment when establishing an accrual for \\npotential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding of information currently available related to the legal evaluation and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and senior management. These matters may be in various stages of investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was not considered or was considered remote in anticipated occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. \\nThe outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject \\nto significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. \\nSee Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for additional information. \\nGoodwill Impairment \\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter           or  more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors         warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long          -term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue         generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by         regulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in market capitalization. \\nWe identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill \\nimpairment at the reportable operating segment level or one level below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using both an income approach and a market approach which are intended to reflect Company performance and expectations as well as external market conditions. The methodologies for calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are periodically assessed by senior management and revised as necessary. \\nThe income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) \\nanalysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our reporting units, which includes future expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, as well as considerations related to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed by senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, we incorporate a terminal value estimate based on an assumed long-term growth rate. We discount these forecasted cash flows using a consistent rate derived from the capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of equity for our reporting units, which reflects risks and uncertainties in the financial markets and in our internally generated business projections. \\nThe market approach utilizes observable market data from \\ncomparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The results of the market approach include a control premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in the selection of comparable companies and includes those with the most similar business activities. \\nThe aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our \\nmarket capitalization for our fourth quarter 2022 assessment. Factors that we considered in our assessment and contributed to this difference included: (i) an overall premium that would be paid to gain control of the operating and financial decisions of the Company, (ii) synergies that we believe may not be reflected in the price of the Company’s common stock, and (iii) risks or benefits at the Company level that may not be reflected in the aggregated fair value of the individual reporting units, such as the impacts of a variety of historical matters, including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters. \\nBased on our fourth quarter 2022 assessment, there was no \\nimpairment of goodwill at December 31, 2022. The fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts by substantial amounts, with the exception of our Consumer Lending reporting unit. Although the fair value of our Consumer Lending reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by more than 10%, it was the most sensitive to changes in valuation assumptions, particularly related to the financial forecasts of the supporting businesses. The home lending business may experience uncertainty related to the current mortgage origination market and the outcome of planned changes to the business model. The credit card business has forecasted higher loan balances driven by growth from new products. Adverse changes to these forecasts may result in an impairment. Using our fourth quarter 2022 assessment, we would need to \\nWells Fargo & Company 64 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 73}),\n",

The Update also requires more frequent updates for insurance assumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate for traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023, with retroactive application to prior periods. The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the policyholder’s life once the account values are exhausted. These guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and are measured at fair value. \\nAt adoption, the effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value of our market risk benefits, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk, was approximately $325 million as of January 1, 2023. The adjustment increased our retained earnings and regulatory capital amounts and ratios. The adjustment for the impact of our own credit risk recorded as an increase to other comprehensive income was approximately $15 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2023. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality assumptions. We economically hedge the market volatility, where feasible. \\nChanges in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs did not have a material impact upon adoption. \\nASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method \\nThe Update, effective January 1, 2023 (with early adoption permitted), establishes the portfolio layer method, which expands an entity’s ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial assets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon adoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The Update improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale debt securities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets. \\nUpon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 days after the adoption date. \\nIn January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities with an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost of $23.9 billion from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale and designated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges using the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities was recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately $566 million of unrealized losses associated with available-for-sale debt securities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes. \\n(continued on following page) \\nWells Fargo & Company 65 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 74}),\n",

We discuss below risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the Company. \\nECONOMIC, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, AND LIQUIDITY RISKS \\nOur financial results have been, and will continue to be,           materially  affected by   general economic conditions, and a \\xa0     deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial         markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other          businesses and our financial results and condition.       \\xa0 We  generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the            loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantia           l  amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest            income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and            commercial lending and banking businesses. These businesses        have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the            state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels an         d  home prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty         stemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters,         including concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, ta         xes  and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impac           t  the global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including        international political unrest or disturbances, such as the con         flict  in Ukraine, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices          ,  restrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliato       ry  measures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the         stability of financial markets and the global economy. Any          impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to th            e  U.S.  economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global           economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions         and/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters o          r  any other events or factors that may disrupt or weaken the U.S            .  or global economy   , \\xa0could materially adversely affect our      \\nfinancial results and condition. \\xa0   \\xa0\\nA weakening in business or economic conditions, including \\nhigher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as higher interest rates, can also adversely affect our customers’ ability to repay their loans or other obligations, which can negatively impact our credit performance. If unemployment levels worsen or if home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand for our products, including our consumer and commercial loans, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest income and our earnings. \\nA deterioration in business and economic conditions, which \\nmay erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our investment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, markets and investment banking businesses. For example, because investment advisory fees are often based on the value of assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively affect the performance of products we have provided to customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture capital business and trading activities, including through heightened counterparty credit risk. Any deterioration in global financial markets and economies, including as a result of any international political unrest or disturbances, may adversely affect the revenue and earnings of our international operations, particularly our global financial institution and correspondent banking services. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” sections in this Report. \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and financial results and any further impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy; disrupted global supply chains; affected equity market valuations; and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and unemployment levels. As a result of the pandemic, the demand for our products and services has, at times, been significantly impacted, which adversely affected our revenue. The pandemic also resulted in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly for industries most directly and adversely affected by the pandemic, such as travel and entertainment. \\nMoreover, the pandemic created additional operational and \\ncompliance risks, including the need to quickly implement and execute new pandemic-related programs and procedures, comply with rapidly changing regulatory requirements, address any increased risk of fraudulent activity, and protect the integrity and functionality of our systems, networks, and operations while a larger number of our employees and those of our third-party service providers may spend more time working remotely than prior to the pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we previously suspended certain mortgage foreclosure activities and provided fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other assistance for certain consumer and commercial lending customers. Furthermore, our participation in governmental measures taken to address the economic impact from the pandemic could \\nWells Fargo & Company 69 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n",

In addition, we previously reduced our common stock dividend and temporarily suspended share repurchases. The pandemic also increased the likelihood and/or magnitude of the other risks described herein, including credit, market and operational related risks. \\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further \\nimpacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Depending on future developments, the COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic could result in the occurrence of new, unanticipated adverse effects on us or the recurrence of adverse effects similar to those already experienced. \\nChanges in interest rates and financial market values could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, including as a result of recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers. Changes in either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin could contract. \\nThe amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect \\nour yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may continue to negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023. \\nChanges in the slope of the yield curve – or the spread \\nbetween short-term and long-term interest rates – could also reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the FRB. \\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on \\nour earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based on changes in interest rates. \\nWe generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There \\nis always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or option volatility could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. \\nBecause of changing economic and market conditions, as         \\nwell as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance o          f  any underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize othe          r-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods on the         securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the debt securiti          es  we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer            creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is          exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign          exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection          with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to          accommodate the investment and risk management activities of         our customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to            manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt securities an         d  equity securities held for trading are carried at fair value wi           th  realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninteres         t  income. As part of our business to support our customers, we            trade public debt and equity securities and other financial          instruments that are subject to market fluctuations with gains          and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although hig          h  market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-related         losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse effect o           n our   businesses as a result of reduced customer activity levels.          Although we have processes in place to measure and monitor the            risks associated with our trading activities, including stress         testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance that           our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding loss          es  that could have a material adverse effect on our financial resu           lts. \\nThe value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity \\nsecurities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are carried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of factors, including general economic and market conditions, the prospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company \\nWells Fargo & Company 70 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 79}),\n",

The administrator of LIBOR ceased publication of LIBOR settings on a representative basis on December 31, 2021, with the exception of the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings, which will no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Additionally, federal banking regulators issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR in new contracts. We have a significant number of assets and liabilities, such as legacy commercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt, referenced to LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. When any such benchmark rate or other referenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instrument. \\nThis could impact the financial performance of previously \\nbooked transactions, result in losses on financial instruments we hold, require different hedging strategies or result in ineffective or increased basis risk on existing hedges, impact the overall interest rate environment and the availability or cost of floating-rate funding, affect our capital and liquidity planning and management, or have other adverse financial consequences. There can be no assurance that any new benchmark rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or other financial metric will be an adequate alternative to LIBOR or produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR. In addition, the transition away from LIBOR will continue to require changes to existing transaction data, products, systems, models, operations, and pricing processes, as well as the modification or renegotiation of contracts that reference USD LIBOR. It may also continue to result in significant operational, systems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance and operational costs, and heightened expectations and scrutiny from regulators, and could result in litigation, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. Furthermore, the transition away from widely used benchmark rates like LIBOR could result in customers or other market participants challenging the determination of their interest payments, disputing the interpretation or implementation of fallback provisions and other transition related changes, or entering into fewer transactions or postponing their financing needs, which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business. Moreover, to the extent borrowers with loans referenced to LIBOR, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, experience higher interest payments as a result of the transition to a new benchmark rate, our customers’ ability to repay their loans may be adversely affected, which can negatively impact our credit performance. \\nFor additional information on the discontinuation of LIBOR \\nand the steps we are taking to address and mitigate the risks we have identified, see the “Overview – Recent Developments – LIBOR Transition” section in this Report. \\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business, and our financial results and condition could be materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity. We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and international money through capital markets. \\nOur liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business \\ncould be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; disruptions or volatility in the repurchase market which also may increase our short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or restrictions; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws on lines of credit; and, as described below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. For example, concerns over geopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as global economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility. \\nIn addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels, \\nincluding any potential failure to raise the debt limit, and any associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings may cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition. \\nWells Fargo & Company 71 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 80}),\n",

We compete with banks and other financial \\nservices companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive other investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money market mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our liquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit balances in order to manage under the asset cap. \\nIf we are unable to continue to fund our assets through            \\ncustomer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms          or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwis            e fail   to manage our liquidity effectively (including on an intra-day          or  intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest margin, fin        ancial  results and condition may be materially adversely affected. As          we  did during the financial crisis, we may also need, or be requir            ed by   our regulators, to raise additional capital through the issuanc    \\xa0     e of   common stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing          stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate our common stock          dividend to preserve capital or to raise additional capital.         \\xa0\\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management –         \\nAsset/Liability Management” section in this Report.      \\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial results and condition. Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other external factors, including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional collateral or funding obligations which, depending on the severity of the downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. \\nFor information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk \\nManagement – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state law, as well as certain contractual arrangements, can limit those dividends. Wells Fargo & Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its funding and liquidity from dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and some of our nonbank subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to the Parent. In addition, under a Support Agreement dated June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. \\nFor additional information, see the “Regulation and \\nSupervision – Dividend Restrictions” and “– Holding Company Structure” sections in our 2022 Form 10-K and to Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nREGULATORY RISKS \\nCurrent and future legislation and/or regulation could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position. Our parent company, our subsidiary banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those related to our brokerage business, are subject to significant and extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where they conduct business. These regulations generally protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers, investors, employees, or the banking and financial system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. Economic, market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws and regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we do business and the products and services that we provide, affect or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our revenue, affect our compliance and risk management activities, increase our capital requirements, impose additional fees, assessments or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial services industry, and adversely affect our business operations or have other negative consequences. Our businesses and revenue in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject to risks from political, economic and social developments in \\nWells Fargo & Company 72 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 81}),\n",

In addition, greater government oversight and scrutiny of Wells Fargo, as well as financial services companies generally, has increased our operational and compliance costs as we must continue to devote substantial resources to enhancing our procedures and controls and meeting heightened regulatory standards and expectations. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements, standards or expectations, either in the U.S. or in non-U.S. jurisdictions, could continue to result in significant fees, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse consequences. \\nOur consumer businesses, including our mortgage, auto, \\ncredit card and other consumer lending and non-lending businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory examinations and/or investigations. In particular, the CFPB’s rules may continue to increase our compliance costs and require changes in our business practices, which could limit or negatively affect the products and services that we offer our customers. If we fail to meet enhanced regulatory requirements and expectations with respect to our consumer businesses, we may be subject to increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities including the products and services we can provide, and/or harm to our reputation. \\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a \\ncomprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and the CFTC, SEC, and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based swaps, and derivatives activities. These rules may continue to negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities. \\nWe are also subject to various rules and regulations related \\nto the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These rules and regulations require us to, among other things, implement policies and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and corruption, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply with these rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully effective or do not meet heightened regulatory standards or expectations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. \\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations \\nenacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental authorities relating to the privacy of the information of customers, employees and others. These laws and regulations, among other things, increase our compliance obligations; have a significant impact on our businesses’ collection, processing, sharing, use, and retention of personal data and reporting of data breaches; and provide for significantly increased penalties for non-compliance. \\nIn addition, we are subject to a number of consent orders \\nand other regulatory actions, including a February 2018 consent order with the FRB regarding the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. This consent order limits the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order to the level as of December 31, 2017, until certain conditions are met. This limitation could continue to adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are also subject to April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. In addition, we are subject to a September 2021 consent order with the OCC regarding loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business. Similarly, we are subject to a December 2022 consent order with the CFPB regarding multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. \\nUnder the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, the Bank \\nremains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in November 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain non-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors and senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain individuals and employees. \\nThe Company may be subject to further actions, including \\nthe imposition of additional consent orders, regulatory agreements or civil money penalties, by federal regulators regarding similar or other issues. Furthermore, issues or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which could be significant. For example, in September 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business. Compliance with the February 2018 FRB consent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent orders, the September 2021 OCC consent order, the December 2022 CFPB consent order, and any other consent orders or regulatory actions, as well as the implementation of their requirements, may continue to increase the Company’s costs, require the Company to reallocate resources away from growing its existing businesses, subject the Company to business restrictions, negatively impact the Company’s capital and liquidity, and require the Company to undergo significant changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. For additional information on the Company’s consent orders, see the “Overview” section in this Report. \\nOther future regulatory initiatives that could significantly \\naffect our business include proposals to reform the housing finance market in the United States. These proposals, among other things, consider ending the conservatorships of the GSEs and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in buying mortgage loans or guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities (MBS), as well as the implementation of reforms relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage market. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the adoption of any legislation regarding the GSEs and/or the home mortgage market, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain. \\nAny other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, \\nalso could significantly change our regulatory environment and increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may pursue or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial services \\nWells Fargo & Company 73 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 82}),\n",

Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC, Wells Fargo prepares and periodically submits resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” designed to facilitate our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the FRB or FDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution plans. If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that a resolution plan has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or operations. \\nIn addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and \\nperiodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. The Bank must also prepare and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets. \\nOur security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of\\n\\tWells Fargo even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full.\\n\\t\\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority,” which allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. \\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \\na single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo. \\nTo facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, we \\nentered into the Support Agreement, pursuant to which the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets to the IHC and will continue to transfer assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank and certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Parent. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit. If certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented. \\nAny resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on           \\nshareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of th         e  Parent, while the Parent’s subsidiaries may continue to operate         .  Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive           significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Paren          t’s  security holders could face significant or complete losses. Thi         s  outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the           U.S.  Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly          liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted         using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple poin            t of   entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its             subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution       proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multipl          e  point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiar            ies  could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s            security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy prove        d  to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater los          ses  than if the strategy had not been implemented.        \\nFor additional information, see the “Regulatory Matters – \\n‘Living Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in this Report. \\nBank regulations and rules may require higher capital and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our business, or provide loans or other products and services to our customers. The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and our insured depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators have issued final rules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. \\nIn addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced \\ncapital and risk-management standards on large financial firms pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital plan rule that establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and \\nWells Fargo & Company 74 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 83}),\n",

The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress and has proposed additional requirements regarding effective risk management practices at large BHCs, including its expectations for boards of directors and senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has also established heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks, such as the Bank. \\nThe Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, \\nliquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, such as through the adoption or implementation of new or revised Basel standards, or as a result of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk profile, could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product offerings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, new capital requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In addition, federal banking regulations may continue to increase our compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our business or provide loans or other products and services to our customers. \\nFor additional information, see the “Capital Management,” \\n“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters” sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nFRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition. The FRB regulates the supply of money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. The FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023 to address high inflation. As noted above, changes in the interest rate environment and yield curve which may result from the FRB’s actions could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest margin. \\nCREDIT RISKS \\nIncreased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \\nWhen we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. We also incur credit risk in connection with trading and other activities. As noted above, if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and counterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices, higher unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in consumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses. \\nFuture allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a \\nvariety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2022, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nCredit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. \\nWe may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or geography may also impact related or dependent industries or the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in such industries to meet their financial obligations. We experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in many markets, including the Central Valley California market and several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may \\nWells Fargo & Company 75 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 84}),\n",

Moreover, deterioration in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could result in materially higher credit losses, including for our residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize. \\nWe are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. \\nA deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including increases in interest rates, declines in commercial property values, and/or changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions, such as a continued decrease in the demand for office space, could result in materially higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition. \\nChallenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions \\nmay increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in non-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material adverse effect on our credit performance and results of operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. operations. \\nDue to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain         \\nderivative transactions through central counterparty      clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to thes         e  CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we            may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the              CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults              on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of             non-performance by our clients for which we clear transactions          through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not          sufficiently covered by available collateral.     \\nFor additional information regarding credit risk, see the \\n“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” section and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nOPERATIONAL, STRATEGIC AND LEGAL RISKS \\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. \\nAs a large financial institution that serves customers through numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking and other distribution channels across the U.S. and internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have increasingly used the internet and mobile banking to provide products and services to our customers, as customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, and as cyber and other information security attacks have become more prevalent and complex, our operational systems, controls and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there have been and could in the future be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks or other information security incidents. Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant costs, and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including their security measures and controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover critical business processes or operations that have been disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences of such disruptions. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers. For example, on February 7, 2019, we experienced system issues caused by an automatic power shutdown at one of our main data center facilities. Although applications and related workloads were systematically re-routed to back-up data centers throughout the day, certain of our services, including our online and mobile banking systems, certain mortgage origination systems, and certain ATM functions, experienced disruptions that delayed service to our customers. \\nAs a result of financial institutions and technology systems \\nbecoming more interconnected and complex, any operational incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could continue to be sources of operational risk to us, including from information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies in the performance of their responsibilities. These risks are heightened to the extent we rely on a single third party or on third parties in a single geographic area. We are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common service provider to our third parties could impede their ability to provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our business, or other negative consequences. \\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls \\nor operating systems that support our businesses and customers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse \\nWells Fargo & Company 76 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",

Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, the increase in remote work arrangements, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or other information to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Geopolitical matters, such as the conflict in Ukraine, may also elevate the risk of an information security threat, particularly by foreign state-sponsored parties or their supporters. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, software, networks, and our customers’ devices continue to be the target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or the disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures and inappropriately circumvents information security controls for personal gain or other improper purposes. \\nDue to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of \\nfinancial institutions and technology systems, an information security incident at a third party or a third party’s downstream service providers may increase the risk of loss or material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. In addition, third parties (including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as internet, mobile technology, hardware, software, and cloud service providers, continue to be sources of information security risk to us. We could suffer material harm, including business disruptions, losses or remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences as a result of the failure of those third parties to adequately or appropriately safeguard their technologies, systems, networks, hardware, and software, or as a result of our or our customers’ data being compromised due to information security incidents affecting those third parties. \\nOur risk and exposure to information security threats \\nremains heightened because of, among other things, the persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the current global economic and political environment. For example, Wells Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to continue to be required to expend significant resources to develop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the investigation of any information security breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities or losses associated with an information security breach. \\nCyber attacks or other information security incidents \\naffecting us or third parties (including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, or affecting the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \\nOur framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in mitigating risk and loss to us. Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest \\nWells Fargo & Company 77 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 86}),\n",

However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the inability to align performance management and compensation to achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We process a large number of transactions each day and are exposed to risks or losses if we do not accurately or completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to human error or otherwise; if we are unable to detect and prevent fraudulent activity; or if an employee or third-party service provider fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other misconduct. \\nIn certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor \\nand predict risks, such as market, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse consequences, and any required modifications or changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and requirements and result in increased operational and compliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could result in ineffective risk management practices, business decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or automate our business decisions and risk management practices, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or human assessment or accurately predict future events or exposures. Previous financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory reforms highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells Fargo in particular, build and maintain robust risk management policies and practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \\nWe may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory proceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to retail sales practices and instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Various government entities and offices have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016, and various non-governmental parties filed lawsuits against us seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. The Company has entered into various settlements to resolve these investigations and proceedings, as a result of which we have incurred monetary penalties, costs, and business restrictions. If we are unable to meet any ongoing obligations under these settlements, we may incur additional monetary or other penalties or be required to make admissions of wrongdoing and comply with other conditions, which can lead to restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, limitations on our ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the loss of customers, and/or other adverse consequences. Any inability to meet our ongoing obligations under these settlements, depending on the sanctions and remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, negative publicity or public opinion resulting from these matters may increase the risk of reputational harm to our business, which can impact our ability to keep and attract customers, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, result in the loss of revenue, or have other material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. \\nFurthermore, we have identified and may in the future \\nidentify areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including as a result of our continuing efforts to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure. For example, we have identified certain issues related to past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain issues related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection waiver or insurance agreements. The identification of such areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, and in some cases has already resulted in, additional remediation costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences. \\nFor additional information, see the “Overview – Retail Sales \\nPractices Matters” and “Overview – Customer Remediation Activities” sections and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations or from any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, we are subject to heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly complex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject to consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Similarly, regulators may be more likely to pursue investigations or proceedings against us to the extent that we are or have previously been subject to other regulatory actions. Also, the laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even conflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal and state law or differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to the products and services we may offer or other business activities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance difficulties or issues. Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require us to report transactions and other information to regulators and \\nWells Fargo & Company 78 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",

We may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on our business, or other negative consequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately provide regulatory reports, customer notices or disclosures. Moreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures in place at the time designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain non-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties or restrictions on certain activities for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or regulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, including any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent orders or other regulatory actions, could result in significant fees, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, reputational harm, loss of customers, or other negative consequences. \\nReputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry generally, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Reputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased substantially because of our size and profile in the financial services industry, sales practices related matters, and instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests with and among our customers; environmental, social and governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party service providers that could potentially harm customers or our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets. \\nWells Fargo and other financial institutions have been \\ntargeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, which have included disrupting the operation of our retail banking locations, and have been subject to negative public commentary, including with respect to the fees charged for various products and services. Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have also been subject to negative publicity as a result of providing or reducing financial services to or making investments in industries or organizations subject to stakeholder concerns. There can be no assurance that continued protests or negative public opinion of the Company specifically or large financial institutions generally will not harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \\nIf we are unable to develop and execute effective business plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive standing and results of operations could suffer. In order to advance our business goals, we may undertake business plans or strategies related to, among other things, our organizational structure, our compliance and risk management framework, our expenses and efficiency, the types of products and services we offer, the types of businesses we engage in, the geographies in which we operate, the manner in which we serve our clients and customers, the third parties with which we do business, and the methods and distribution channels by which we offer our products and services. Accomplishing these business plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require significant financial, technological, management and other resources, may divert management attention and resources away from other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses and ability to generate revenue. There is no guarantee that any business plans or strategies, including our current efficiency initiatives, will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are unable to develop or execute effective business plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of operations may be adversely affected. \\nIn addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest \\ncertain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets. \\nSimilarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our \\nproducts, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to \\nWells Fargo & Company 79 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n",

Furthermore, difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the acquired company or business operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations and/or employees. \\nOur operations and business could be adversely affected by the impacts of climate change. The physical effects of climate change, including the increased prevalence and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere with our operations or those of our third-party service providers, which could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause losses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain industries, sectors or geographies, which may increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon economy could affect our business practices or result in additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions and expectations related to climate change and its impacts, could require us to change certain of our business and/or risk management practices, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and business. Moreover, our reputation may be damaged as a result of our response to climate change or our strategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if we are unable or perceived to be unable to achieve our objectives or if our response is disliked, disfavored, or perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. For additional information on regulatory developments in response to climate change, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this Report. \\nWe are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse consequences from legal actions. Wells Fargo and some of its subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and many of those proceedings and investigations expose Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal action may be substantially higher than any amounts accrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding or investigation, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\nAs noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory \\noversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition to imposing potentially significant monetary penalties, business restrictions, and other sanctions, regulatory authorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. \\nFor additional information, see Note 13 (Legal Actions) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nMORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS \\nOur mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new mortgage loans. We earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair value of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase due to a decline in the likelihood of prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. \\nWe typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge \\nour mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities. \\nWe rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet \\ntheir conforming loan requirements and on government insuring agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee loans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their purchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, and thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). As noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain. In addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs’ or government insuring agencies’ standards, which are generally retained on our balance sheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be used to originate new loans. \\nWells Fargo & Company 80 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 89}),\n",

For residential mortgage loans that we originate, we could become subject to monetary damages and other civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the loans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or regulations. \\nAdditionally, for residential mortgage loans that we \\noriginate and sell, we may be required to repurchase the loans or indemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements under which we sell the loans or in the insurance or guaranty agreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. We establish a mortgage repurchase liability that reflects management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of the liability depends on economic factors and other external conditions, the level of the liability is difficult to estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is subject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market worsen, we could have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring significant additions to the repurchase liability. \\nFurthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for \\nthe mortgage loans we service, we may be terminated as servicer or master servicer, required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses, and/or contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses, any of which could significantly reduce our net servicing income. \\nWe may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers and/or \\nsecuritization investors, legal proceedings, or other adverse consequences if we fail to meet our servicing obligations, including with respect to mortgage foreclosure actions or if we experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our net servicing income and the fair value of our MSRs may be negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure or other servicing related costs. In addition, we may continue to be subject to fines, business restrictions, and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, including with respect to our foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation activities such as loan modifications or forbearances, or our servicing of flood zone properties. Any of these actions may harm our reputation, negatively affect our residential mortgage origination or servicing business, or result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies, or other enforcement actions. We may also face risks, including regulatory, compliance, and market risks, as we pursue our previously announced plans to reduce the amount of residential mortgage loans we service. \\nFor additional information, see the “Overview,” “Risk \\nManagement – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities,” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” sections and Note 13 (Legal Actions) and Note 18 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nCOMPETITIVE RISKS \\nWe face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. We compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and current economic conditions. Our success depends on, among other things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring relationships with our customers based on the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, market share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the current economic, regulatory and political environment for large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customer relationships and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. \\nContinued technological advances and the growth of \\ne-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including digital currencies and alternative payment methods, may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. We may not respond effectively to these and other competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to sell products at lower prices, increase our investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing products and services, and/or develop new products and services to respond to our customers’ needs and preferences. To the extent we are not successful in developing and introducing new products and services or responding or adapting to the competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we may lose customer relationships and our revenue growth and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could adversely affect our business performance, competitive position and future prospects. The success of Wells Fargo is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, capital markets, risk management and technology, the competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of succession for our senior leadership positions.

As a large financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same compensation limitations. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, including successors for senior leadership positions, our business performance, competitive position and future prospects may be adversely affected. \\nFINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS \\nChanges in accounting standards, and changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect our financial results and condition. From time to time the FASB and the SEC update the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may update their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict, and could materially affect our financial results and condition, including requiring a retrospective restatement of prior period financial statements. Similarly, any change in our accounting policies could also materially affect our financial statements. For additional information, see the “Current Accounting Developments” section in this Report. \\nOur financial statements require certain assumptions and estimates and rely on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including, among other items, in determining the allowance for credit losses, the liability for contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such as debt securities, loans held for sale, MSRs, derivative assets and liabilities, and equity securities. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial results are incorrect or different from actual results, we could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could be significant. For a description of our critical accounting policies, see the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires \\nour management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our reputation or stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. We could also be required to devote significant resources to remediate any material weakness. In addition, our customers may rely on the effectiveness of certain of our operational and internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be independent of us, we could be required to engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse consequences. \\n* * * \\nAny factor described in this Report or in any of our other SEC \\nfilings could by itself, or together with other factors, adversely affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2023 for material changes to the above discussion of risk factors. There are factors not discussed above or elsewhere in this Report that could adversely affect our financial results and condition. \\nWells Fargo & Company 82 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 91}),\n",

Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. \\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting \\nInternal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that: \\n•\\t\\t pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; \\n•\\t\\t provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and \\n•\\t\\t provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections \\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in \\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during fourth quarter 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

We provide banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock outstanding. \\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in the financial services industry. To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including: \\n•\\t\\t allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses)); \\n•\\t\\t valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) (Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \\n•\\t\\t valuations of financial instruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)); \\n•\\t\\t liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 13 (Legal Actions)); \\n•\\t\\t income taxes (Note 22 (Income Taxes)); and \\n•\\t\\t goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets)). \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. \\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022 \\nIn 2022, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \\n•\\t\\t Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2020-06 – Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity \\n•\\t\\t ASU 2021-05 – Leases (Topic 842): Lessors – Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments \\n•\\t\\t ASU 2021-10 – Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance \\n•\\t\\t ASU 2022-06 – Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 \\nASU 2020-06   simplifies the accounting for convertible financial       \\ninstruments that embody characteristics of debt and equity by          (1)  eliminating accounting models for convertible financial       instruments with cash conversion and beneficial conversion        features within Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)       Subtopic 470-20, (2) removing three equity classification        requirements for a contract in an entity’s own equity to qualif           y  for the derivative scope exception in ASC Subtopic 815-40, and           (3)  prescribing the method used for computing earnings per         share. We adopted this Update prospectively in first quarter          2022. This Update did not have a material impact to our            consolidated financial statements.   \\nASU 2021-05 amends ASC Topic 842 – Leases and provides specific guidance for lessors whose leases include variable lease payments that are not dependent on a reference index or rate and otherwise would have resulted in the recognition of a loss at lease commencement (a day 1 loss). Prior to ASU 2016-02, variable lease payments were excluded from the definition of lease payments for lessors measuring their net investment loss in a sales-type lease or direct financing lease. This often resulted in a day 1 loss, even if the lessor expected the arrangement to be profitable overall. We adopted this Update prospectively in first quarter 2022. This Update did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. \\nASU 2021-1  0  created a new topic in the codification, ASC Topic          832.  The ASU requires annual disclosures for a business entity          that has received government assistance and uses a grant or           contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting         guidance. We adopted this Update in fourth quarter 2022 on a            prospective basis. This Update did not have a material impact t           o  our consolidated financial statements.     \\nASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date of ASC Topic 848 – Reference Rate Reform from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, to extend the ability to apply the guidance in Topic 848, which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the burden in accounting for reference rate reform on financial reporting. We adopted this Update prospectively in fourth quarter 2022. This Update did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. \\nConsolidation \\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent and our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. When our consolidated subsidiaries follow specialized industry accounting, that accounting is retained in consolidation. \\nWe are also a variable interest holder in certain entities in \\nwhich equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or where the entity does not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties (collectively referred to as variable interest entities (VIEs)). Our variable interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the fair value of the entity’s net assets. We consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary, which is when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or not a variable interest we hold could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of \\nWells Fargo & Company 91 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

We assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. \\nSignificant intercompany accounts and transactions are \\neliminated in consolidation. When we have significant influence over operating and financing decisions for a company but do not own a majority of the voting equity interests, we account for the investment using the equity method of accounting, which requires us to recognize our proportionate share of the company’s earnings. If we do not have significant influence, we account for the equity security under the fair value method, cost method or measurement alternative. \\nNoncontrolling interests represent the portion of net \\nincome and equity attributable to third-party owners of consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned by Wells Fargo. Substantially all of our noncontrolling interests relate to our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. \\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash \\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are recorded at amortized cost and include cash on hand, cash items in transit, and amounts due from or held with other depository institutions. See Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) for additional information on the restrictions on cash and cash equivalents. \\nTrading Activities \\nWe engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers. These activities predominantly occur in our Corporate and Investment Banking reportable operating segment. Trading assets and liabilities include debt securities, equity securities, loans held for sale, derivatives and short sales, which are reported within our consolidated balance sheet based on the accounting classification of the instrument. In addition, debt securities that are held for investment purposes that we have elected to account for under the fair value method, are classified as trading. \\nOur trading assets and liabilities are carried on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net gains from trading and securities within noninterest income. Interest income and interest expense are recognized in net interest income. \\nCustomer accommodation trading activities include our \\nactions as an intermediary to buy and sell financial instruments and market-making activities. We also take positions to manage our exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold financial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short positions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary, we interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the purchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the anticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we may purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to manage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an offsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure to the customer transaction. We earn income based on the transaction price difference between the customer transaction and the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of the positions are recorded. \\nOur market-making activities include taking long and short \\ntrading positions to facilitate customer order flow. These activities are typically executed on a short-term basis. As a market-maker we earn income due to: (1) the difference between the price paid or received for the purchase and sale of the security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net interest income of the positions, and (3) the changes in fair value of the trading positions held on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we may enter into separate derivative or security positions to manage our exposure related to our long and short trading positions taken in our market-making activities. Income earned on these market-making activities are reflected in earnings where the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of the positions are recorded. \\nAvailable-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities \\nOur investments in debt securities that are not held for tradin           g  purposes are classified as either      available-for-sale (AFS) or held    -to-maturity (HTM).   \\nInvestments in debt securities for which the Company does \\nnot have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as AFS. AFS debt securities are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The amount reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) is net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and applicable income taxes. Investments in debt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as HTM. HTM debt securities are measured at amortized cost, net of ACL. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) for additional information. \\nINTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS RECOGNITION Unamortized \\npremiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the security using the effective interest method, except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium. For purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the next call date using the effective interest method. As principal repayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues unchanged. \\nWe recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt \\nsecurities in net gains from trading and securities within noninterest income using the specific identification method. \\nIMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES Unrealized losses on AFS debt \\nsecurities are driven by a number of factors, including changes in interest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of debt securities, and prepayment rates which impact MBS and collateralized loan obligations (CLO). Additional considerations for certain types of AFS debt securities include: \\n•\\t\\t Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, including federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit movements given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government. \\n•\\t\\t Debt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are most impacted by changes in the relationship between municipal and term funding credit curves rather than by changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities. \\n•\\t\\t Structured securities, such as MBS and CLO, are also impacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets underlying the security. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis, we recognize impairment in earnings if we have the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Impairment is recognized in net gains on \\nWells Fargo & Company 92 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 101}),\n",

Following the recognition of this impairment, the AFS debt security’s new amortized cost basis is fair value. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in earnings, we record an ACL as of the balance sheet date to the extent unrealized loss is due to credit losses. See the “Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this Note for our accounting policies relating to the ACL for debt securities, which also includes debt securities classified as HTM. \\nTRANSFERS  BETWEEN C  ATEGORIES  OF DEBT S   ECURITIES   Transfers  \\nof debt securities from the AFS to HTM classification are           recorded at fair value, and accordingly the amortized cost of t           he  security  transferred to HTM    is adjusted to fair value     . Unrealized   \\ngains or losses reported in AOCI at the transfer date are            amortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortize          d  premiums and discounts using the effective interest method.         Any ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model           is reversed and an ACL under the HTM debt security model is re             -established.  The reversal and re-establishment of the ACL are         recorded in provision for credit losses.      \\nTransfers of debt securities from the HTM to AFS          \\nclassification are recorded at fair value. The HTM amortized co          st  (excluding any ACL previously recorded under the HTM debt          security model) becomes the AFS amortized cost, and the debt           security is remeasured at fair value with the unrealized gains           and  losses reported in OCI. Any ACL previously recorded under the           HTM debt security model is reversed and an ACL under the AFS             debt security model is re-established. The reversal and re         -establishment of the ACL are recorded in        provision expense  .  Transfers from HTM to AFS are       only expected to occur under      \\nlimited circumstances.  \\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES We \\ngenerally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors similar to those described for loans. When we place a debt security on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and suspend the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. If the ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt on a nonaccrual debt security, any cash collected is first applied to reduce the security’s amortized cost basis to zero, followed by recovery of amounts previously charged off, and subsequently to interest income. Generally, we return a debt security to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the contractual terms of the security and collectability of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. \\nOur debt securities are considered past due when \\ncontractually required principal or interest payments have not been made on the due dates. \\nOur charge-off policy for debt securities are similar to those \\ndescribed for loans. Subsequent to charge-off, the debt security will be designated as nonaccrual and follow the process described above for any cash received. \\nSecurities and Other Collateralized Financing Agreements \\nResale and repurchase agreements, as well as securities borrowing and lending agreements, are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. We monitor the fair value of securities or other assets purchased and sold as well as the collateral pledged and received. Additional collateral is pledged or returned to maintain the appropriate collateral position for the transactions. These financing transactions do not create material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related monitoring process. \\nWe include securities purchased under securities financing \\nagreements in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements on our consolidated balance sheet. We include collateral other than securities purchased under resale agreements in Loans on our consolidated balance sheet. We include securities sold under securities financing agreements in short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, short-term borrowings were primarily comprised of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. \\nAssets and liabilities arising from securities and other \\ncollateralized financing transactions with a single counterparty are presented net on the balance sheet provided they meet certain criteria that permit balance sheet netting. See Note 18 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) for additional information on our offsetting policy. \\nLoans Held for Sale \\nLoans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes commercial and residential mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. We have elected the fair value option for a majority of residential LHFS (see Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)). The remaining residential LHFS are held at the lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) and are measured on a pool level basis. \\nCommercial LHFS are generally held at LOCOM and are \\nmeasured on an individual loan basis. We have elected the fair value option for certain commercial loans included in LHFS that are used in market-making activities for our trading business. \\nGains and losses on residential and commercial mortgage \\nLHFS are generally recorded in mortgage banking noninterest income. Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net gains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are recognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination costs and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are recognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at LOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale. Interest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate of the loan and is recorded in interest income. \\nCommitments to originate mortgage LHFS are accounted \\nfor as derivatives and are measured at fair value. When a determination is made at the time of commitment to originate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic review under our management evaluation processes, including corporate asset/liability management. If subsequent changes occur, including changes in interest rates, our business strategy, or other market conditions, we may change our intent to hold these loans. When management makes this determination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS portfolio at LOCOM. \\nLoans \\nLoans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. \\nUnearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts \\nand premiums are amortized to interest income generally over \\nWells Fargo & Company 93 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 102}),\n",

Loan commitment fees collected at closing are deferred and amortized to noninterest income on a straight-line basis over the commitment period if loan funding is unlikely. Upon funding, deferred loan commitment fees are amortized to interest income over the contractual life of the loan. \\nLoans also include financing leases where we are the lessor \\n(see the “Leasing Activity” section in this Note for our accounting policy for leases) and resale agreements involving collateral other than securities (see “Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Agreements” section in this Note for our accounting policy for other collateralized financing agreements). \\nSee Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \\nfor additional information regarding our accounting for loans. \\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS We generally place loans on \\nnonaccrual status when: \\n•\\t\\t the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; \\n•\\t\\t they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential mortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; \\n•\\t\\t part of the principal balance has been charged off; or \\n•\\t\\t for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien delinquency status. \\nCredit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are \\ngenerally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past due. \\nWhen we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the \\naccrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and suspend amortization of any net deferred fees. If the ultimate collectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on a nonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash collected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan to zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise, interest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received. Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the terms of the loan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. \\nWe may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a \\nrestructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing status. When a loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) performs in accordance with its modified terms, the loan either continues to accrue interest (for performing loans) or will return to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to the modification). Loans will be placed on nonaccrual status and a corresponding charge-off is recorded if the re-underwriting did not include an evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay or we believe it is probable that principal and interest contractually due under the modified terms of the agreement will not be collectible. Our loans are considered past due when contractually \\nrequired principal or interest payments have not been made on the due dates. \\nLOAN CHARGE-OFF POLICIES For commercial loans, we generally \\nfully charge off or charge down to net realizable value (fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell) for loans secured by collateral when: \\n•\\t\\t management judges the loan to be uncollectible; \\n•\\t\\t repayment is deemed to be protracted beyond reasonable time frames; \\n•\\t\\t the loan has been classified as a loss by either our internal loan review process or our banking regulatory agencies; \\n•\\t\\t the customer has filed bankruptcy and the loss becomes evident owing to a lack of assets; \\n•\\t\\t the loan is 180 days past due unless both well-secured and in the process of collection; or \\n•\\t\\t the loan is probable of foreclosure, and we have received an appraisal of less than the recorded loan balance. \\nFor consumer loans, we fully charge off or charge down to \\nnet realizable value when deemed uncollectible due to bankruptcy or other factors, or no later than reaching a defined number of days past due, as follows: \\n•\\t\\t Residential mortgage loans – We generally charge down to net realizable value when the loan is 180 days past due and fully charge-off when the loan exceeds extended delinquency dates. \\n•\\t\\t Auto loans – We generally fully charge off when the loan is 120 days past due. \\n•\\t\\t Credit card loans – We generally fully charge off when the loan is 180 days past due. \\n•\\t\\t Unsecured loans – We generally fully charge off when the loan is 120 days past due. \\n•\\t\\t Unsecured lines – We generally fully charge off when the loan is 180 days past due. \\n•\\t\\t Other secured loans – We generally fully or partially charge down to net realizable value when the loan is 120 days past due. \\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS In situations where, for \\neconomic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider, the related loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). These modified terms may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term extensions, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize our economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, if applicable. For modifications where we forgive principal, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. If the underwriting for a TDR modification did not include an evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay, the loan is deemed collateral dependent. Other than resolutions such as foreclosures, sales and transfers to held-for-sale, we may remove loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan. \\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS AND OTHER RELIEF RELATED \\nTO COVID-19 The Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security \\nAct (the CARES Act) and the Interagency Statement on Loan \\nModifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) issued by federal regulators in April 2020 (the Interagency Statement) provide \\nWells Fargo & Company 94 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 103}),\n",

Based on guidance in the CARES Act and Interagency Statement, modifications related to the adverse effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that meet certain criteria are exempt from TDR classification. We ceased applying TDR relief provided by the CARES Act upon the expiration of the CARES Act on January 1, 2022. During 2022, we continued to apply the TDR relief provided by the Interagency Statement for eligible COVID-related residential mortgage loan modifications. \\nFor COVID-19-related modifications in the form of payment \\ndeferrals or payment forbearance, delinquency status will not advance and loans that were accruing at the time the relief is provided will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status during the deferral period. Interest accrued during payment deferrals or payment forbearance may be included in the principal balance of the loans and charge-offs will generally be based on delinquency status after the loan exits the deferral or forbearance period. Loans that exit COVID-related deferrals or payment forbearance are placed on nonaccrual status if there is no evidence that the borrower can resume making payments or if the borrower requests additional modifications. \\nFORECLOSED ASSETS Foreclosed assets obtained through our \\nlending activities primarily include real estate. Generally, loans have been written down to their net realizable value prior to foreclosure. Any further reduction to their net realizable value is recorded with a charge to the ACL at foreclosure. We allow up to 90 days after foreclosure to finalize determination of net realizable value. Thereafter, changes in net realizable value are recorded to noninterest expense. The net realizable value of these assets is reviewed and updated periodically depending on the type of property. Certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure are included in accounts receivable, not foreclosed assets. These receivables were loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are measured based on the balance expected to be recovered from the FHA or VA. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nThe ACL is management’s estimate of the current expected life          -time credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit           commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and          unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for           sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for AFS and HTM debt            securities, other financing receivables measured at amortized        cost, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. While we          attribute portions of the allowance to specific financial asse         t  classes (loan and debt security portfolios), loan portfolio         segments (commercial and consumer) or major security type, the          entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company           . \\nOur ACL process involves procedures to appropriately \\nconsider the unique risk characteristics of our financial asset classes, portfolio segments, and major security types. For each loan portfolio segment and each major HTM debt security type, losses are estimated collectively for groups of loans or securities with similar risk characteristics. For loans and securities that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, the losses are estimated individually, which generally includes our nonperforming large commercial loans and non-accruing HTM debt securities. For AFS debt securities, losses are estimated at the individual security level. \\nOur ACL amounts are influenced by a variety of factors, \\nincluding changes in loan and debt security volumes, portfolio credit quality, and general economic conditions. General economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables which will create volatility as those variables change over time. See Table 1.1 for key economic variables used for our loan portfolios. \\nTable 1.1: Key Economic Variables \\n Loan Portfolio   Key economic variables \\n Total commercial •       Gross  domestic  product \\n•       Commercial  real  estate  asset  prices,  where  applicable \\n•       Unemployment  rate \\n Residential mortgage •       Home  price  index \\n•       Unemployment  rate \\n        Other consumer (including credit card, auto, and other consumer) •       Unemployment  rate \\nOur approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses         \\nfor loans and debt securities includes the following key          components: \\n• An initial loss forecast period      of two years for all portfolio       segments and classes of financing receivables and off-        balance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects       management’s expectation of losses based on forward-       looking economic scenarios over that time. We forecast         multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base         scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more          pessimistic (downside) scenarios, which are weighted by        management to estimate future credit losses.      \\n• Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting        to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the             economic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast         period. These long-term averages are based on observations         over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which         may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis.            • The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for           expected prepayments and certain expected extensions,       renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term         when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual          renewals or extension options. We also incorporate any         scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an         extension through a TDR. Credit card loans have         indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine        a contractual life by estimating the application of future          payments to the outstanding loan amount.      \\n• Utilization of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods to         measure credit impairment for loans modified in a troubled          debt restructuring, unless they are collateral dependent and         measured at the fair value of the collateral. The DCF           methods obtain estimated life-time credit losses using the         initial and historical mean loss forecast periods described         above. \\n• For AFS debt securities and certain beneficial interests         classified as HTM, we utilize DCF methods to measure the           \\nWells Fargo & Company 95 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 104}),\n",

For most HTM        \\ndebt securities, the ACL is measured using an expected loss           \\nmodel, similar to the methodology used for loans.        \\nThe ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost is a \\nvaluation account that is deducted from, or added to, the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. When credit expectations change, the valuation account is adjusted with changes reported in provision for credit losses. If amounts previously charged off are subsequently expected to be collected, we may recognize a negative allowance, which is limited to the amount that was previously charged off. For financial assets with an ACL estimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the passage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to expected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot have an associated negative allowance. \\nFor certain financial assets, such as residential real estate \\nloans guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), an agency of the federal government, U. S. Treasury and Agency mortgage-backed debt securities and certain sovereign debt securities, the Company has not recognized an ACL as our expectation of loss is zero, based on historical losses and consideration of current and forecasted conditions. \\nFor financial assets that are collateral-dependent, we will \\nmeasure the ACL based on the fair value of the collateral. If we intend to sell the underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the collateral’s net realizable value. In most situations, based on our charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial asset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For consumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other personal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial real estate or other business assets. \\nWe do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest \\nreceivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed through interest income in a timely manner in line with our non-accrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities. For consumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit, we include an ACL for accrued interest and fees since these loans are neither placed on nonaccrual status nor written off until the loan is 180 days past due. Accrued interest receivables are included in other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans. \\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO S    EGMENT AC  L METHODOLOGY    \\nGenerally, commercial loans, which include net investments in lease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk factors as identified through periodic reviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio reflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with the borrower’s financial strength and the severity of loss in the event of default, considering the quality of any underlying collateral. Probability of default, loss severity at the time of default, and exposure at default are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default within each credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as appropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted economic conditions and credit quality trends. Unfunded credit commitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to derive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated probability of default and loss severity at the time of default are applied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses for unfunded credit commitments. \\nCONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY For \\nconsumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans within those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that estimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of default and exposure at default are typically leveraged to estimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such as residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use attributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the development of our consumer loan models, in addition to home price trends, unemployment trends, and other economic variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses in the consumer portfolio. \\nOTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for \\nqualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level below our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES Our off-balance sheet \\ncredit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally in the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not accounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including standby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off-balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated with the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our discretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial guarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated \\nfor expected credit losses. These other financial assets include accounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-sponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts receivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as central clearing counterparties. Many of these financial assets are generally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss expectation (e.g., government guarantee) based on no historical credit losses and consideration of current and forecasted conditions. Some financial assets, such as loans to employees, maintain an ACL that is presented on a net basis with the related amortized cost amounts in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. A provision for credit losses is not recognized \\nWells Fargo & Company 96 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 105}),\n",

We have elected the practical expedient for these financial assets given collateral maintenance provisions. These provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and customers are required to replenish collateral, if needed. Accordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these financial assets. \\nSee Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \\nfor additional information. \\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Financial Assets \\nFinancial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with more than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since their origination or issuance are purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) assets. PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities and loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an ACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach, there is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition; rather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial asset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income recognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest income recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset. \\nLeasing Activity \\nAS LESSOR We lease equipment to our customers under \\nfinancing or operating leases. Financing leases, which includes both direct financing and sales-type leases, are presented in loans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third-party investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual lease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that we believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The residual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales price for the equipment at lease termination based on sales history adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets. Many of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at prevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at lease termination. \\nOur allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers \\nboth the collectability of the lease payments receivable as well as the estimated residual value of the leased asset. We typically purchase residual value insurance on our financing leases to reduce the risk of loss at lease termination. \\nIn connection with a lease, we may finance the customer’s \\npurchase of other products or services from the equipment vendor and allocate the contract consideration between the use of the asset and the purchase of those products or services. Amounts allocated are reported in loans as commercial and industrial loans, rather than as lease financing. \\nOur primary income from financing leases is interest income \\nrecognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease revenue, such as reimbursement for property taxes, are included in lease income within noninterest income. \\nOperating lease assets are presented in other assets, net of \\naccumulated depreciation. Periodic depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the leased asset and are included in other noninterest expense. Operating lease assets are reviewed periodically for impairment and an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of operating lease assets exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. Recoverability is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the leased assets to undiscounted cash flows expected through the operation or sale of the asset. Impairment charges for operating lease assets are included in other noninterest income. \\nOperating lease rental income for leased assets is recognized \\nin lease income within noninterest income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable revenue on operating leases include reimbursements of costs, including property taxes, which fluctuate over time, as well as rental revenue based on usage. For leases of railcars, revenue for maintenance services provided under the lease is recognized in lease income. \\nWe elected to exclude from revenue and expenses any sales \\ntax incurred on lease payments which are reimbursed by the lessee. Substantially all of our leased assets are protected against casualty loss through third-party insurance. \\nAS LESSEE We enter into lease agreements to obtain the right to \\nuse assets for our business operations, substantially all of which are real estate. Lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets are recognized when we enter into operating or financing leases and represent our obligations and rights to use these assets over the period of the leases and may be re-measured for certain modifications. \\nOperating lease liabilities include fixed and in-substance \\nfixed payments for the contractual duration of the lease, adjusted for renewals or terminations which were considered probable of exercise when measured. The lease payments are discounted using a rate that approximates a collateralized borrowing rate for the estimated duration of the lease as the implicit discount rate is typically not known. The discount rate is updated when re-measurement events occur. The related operating lease ROU assets may differ from operating lease liabilities due to initial direct costs, deferred or prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. \\nWe present operating lease liabilities in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities and the related operating lease ROU assets in other assets. The amortization of operating lease ROU assets and the accretion of operating lease liabilities are reported together as fixed lease expense and are included in occupancy expense within noninterest expense. The fixed lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. \\nSome operating leases include variable lease payments and \\nare recognized as incurred in net occupancy expense within noninterest expense. \\nFor substantially all of our leased assets, we account for \\nconsideration paid under the contract for maintenance or other services as lease payments. We exclude certain asset classes, with original terms of less than one year from the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities. The related short-term lease expense is included in net occupancy expense. \\nFinance lease liabilities are presented in long-term debt and \\nthe associated finance ROU assets are presented in premises and equipment. \\nSee Note 8 (Leasing Activity) for additional information. \\nDeposits, Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt \\nCustomer deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt are recorded at amortized cost, unless we have elected the fair value option for these items.

We do not reclassify long-term debt to short-term borrowings within a year of maturity. \\nRefer to Note 9 (Deposits) for further information on \\ndeposits, Note 10 (Long-Term Debt) for further information on long-term debt, and Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) for additional information on fair value, including fair value option elections. \\nSecuritizations and Beneficial Interests \\nSecuritizations are transactions in which financial assets are sold to a Special Purpose Entity (SPE), which then issues beneficial interests collateralized by the transferred financial assets. Beneficial interests are generally issued in the form of senior and subordinated interests, and in some cases, we may obtain beneficial interests issued by the SPE. Additionally, from time to time, we may re-securitize certain financial assets in a new securitization transaction. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for additional information about our involvement with SPEs. \\nThe assets and liabilities transferred to a SPE are excluded \\nfrom our consolidated balance sheet if the transfer qualifies as a sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE. \\nFor transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we \\nrecognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained (including beneficial interests or mortgage servicing rights) and all liabilities incurred. We record a gain or loss in noninterest income for the difference between assets obtained (net of liabilities incurred) and the carrying amount of the assets sold. Beneficial interests obtained from, and liabilities incurred in, securitizations with off-balance sheet entities may include debt and equity securities, loans, MSRs, derivative assets and liabilities, other assets, and other obligations such as liabilities for mortgage repurchase losses or long-term debt and are accounted for as described within this Note. \\nMortgage Servicing Rights \\nWe recognize MSRs resulting from a sale or securitization of mortgage loans that we originate (asset transfers) or through a direct purchase of such rights. We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. Subsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at fair value. Commercial MSRs are subsequently measured at LOCOM. The valuation and sensitivity of MSRs is discussed further in Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities). \\nFor MSRs carried at fair value, changes in fair value are \\nreported in mortgage banking noninterest income in the period in which the change occurs. MSRs subsequently measured at LOCOM are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. The amortization of MSRs is reported in mortgage banking noninterest income, analyzed monthly and adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment rates, as well as other factors. \\nMSRs accounted for at LOCOM are periodically evaluated \\nfor impairment based on the fair value of those assets. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we stratify MSRs based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, including investor and product type. If, by individual stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds fair value, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. Premises and Equipment \\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We use the straight-line method of depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for premises and equipment was $1.2 billion in 2022 and $1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, up to 10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the estimated useful life (up to 8 years) or the lease term for leasehold improvements. \\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets \\nGoodwill is recorded for business combinations when the purchase price is higher than the fair value of the acquired net assets, including identifiable intangible assets. \\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level \\non an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. We have determined that our reporting units are at the reportable operating segment level or one level below. We identify the reporting units based on how the segments and reporting units are managed, taking into consideration the economic characteristics, nature of the products and services, and customers of the segments and reporting units. We allocate goodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative fair value at the time we acquire a business and when we have a significant business reorganization. If we sell a business, a portion of goodwill is included with the carrying amount of the divested business. \\nWe have the option of performing a qualitative assessment \\nof goodwill. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative test and proceed directly to a quantitative test. If we perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment and conclude it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings multiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, which is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The goodwill impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses as a charge to other noninterest expense and a reduction to the carrying value of goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited. \\nWe amortize customer relationship intangible assets on an \\naccelerated basis over useful lives not exceeding 10 years. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the sum of undiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset. Impairment is permanently recognized by writing down the asset to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. \\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities \\nDERIVATIVES We recognize all derivatives on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet at fair value. On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we categorize the derivative as either an accounting hedge, economic hedge or part of our customer accommodation trading and other portfolio. \\nWells Fargo & Company 98 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 107}),\n",

Cash flow hedges represent the hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received related to a recognized asset or liability. \\nEconomic hedges and customer accommodation trading and \\nother derivatives do not qualify for, or we have elected not to apply, hedge accounting. Economic hedges are derivatives we use to manage interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks associated with our non-trading activities. Customer accommodation trading and other derivatives predominantly represents derivatives related to our trading business activities. We report changes in the fair values of these derivatives in noninterest income or noninterest expense. \\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in income, except for certain derivatives in which a portion is recorded to OCI. We record basis adjustments to the amortized cost of the hedged asset or liability due to the changes in fair value related to the hedged risk with the offset recorded in earnings. We present derivative gains or losses in the same income statement category as the hedged asset or liability, as follows: •\\t\\t For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, amounts are reflected in net interest income; \\n•\\t\\t For hedges of foreign currency risk, amounts representing the fair value changes less the accrual for periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in noninterest income. The periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest income; \\n•\\t\\t For hedges of both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, amounts representing the fair value change less the accrual for periodic cash flow settlements is attributed to both net interest income and noninterest income. The periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest income. \\nThe entire derivative gain or loss is included in the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge \\nrelationships, except for hedges of foreign-currency denominated AFS debt securities and long-term debt liabilities hedged with cross-currency swaps. The change in fair value of these swaps attributable to cross-currency basis spread changes is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial fair value of the excluded component is amortized to net interest income and the difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recorded in earnings is recorded in OCI. \\nCASH FLOW HEDGES We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in OCI. We subsequently reclassify gains and losses from these changes in fair value from OCI to earnings in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the same income statement category as the hedged item. The entire gain or loss on these derivatives is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. \\nDOCUMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT FOR \\nACCOUNTING HEDGES For fair value and cash flow hedges \\nqualifying for hedge accounting, we formally document at \\ninception the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, our risk management objective, strategy and our evaluation of effectiveness for our hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. For fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and offset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for fair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate the conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we also formally assess whether the derivative we designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item using the regression analysis method. \\nDISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING We discontinue hedge \\naccounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, (3) we elect to discontinue hedge accounting, or (4) when the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in a cash flow hedge. \\nWhen we discontinue fair value hedge accounting, we no \\nlonger adjust the previously hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. The remaining cumulative adjustments to the hedged item and accumulated amounts reported in OCI are accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of the asset or liability. For example, for financial debt instruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term debt, these amounts are amortized into net interest income over the remaining life of the asset or liability similar to other amortized cost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is derecognized, the accumulated amounts reported in OCI are immediately reclassified to net interest income. If the derivative continues to be held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in noninterest income. \\nWhen we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting and it is \\nprobable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the accumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date continues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings at which point the related OCI amount is reclassified to net interest income. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued and it is probable the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, the accumulated gains and losses reported in OCI at the de-designation date is immediately reclassified to noninterest income. If the derivative continues to be held after cash flow hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in noninterest income. \\nEMBEDDED DERIVATIVES We may purchase or originate financial \\ninstruments that contain an embedded derivative. At inception of the financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the \\nWells Fargo & Company 99 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 108}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' \\n \\n  \\n Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n \\nembedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at \\nfair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) if a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the embedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate it from the hybrid contract by recording the bifurcated derivative at fair value and the remaining host contract at the difference between the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of the bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried at fair value with changes recorded in noninterest income and reported on our consolidated balance sheet as a derivative asset or liability. The accounting for the remaining host contract is the same as other assets and liabilities of a similar type and reported on our consolidated balance sheet based upon the accounting classification of the instrument. \\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING  By using derivatives, \\nwe are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to the extent subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value and our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent derivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the applicable requirements, including determining the legal enforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present derivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on our consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments (CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA, which considers the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate CVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the counterparties to our derivatives. \\nCash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate \\nderivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with centrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the derivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to separate non-derivative receivables or payables. This cash collateral, also referred to as variation margin, is exchanged based upon derivative fair value changes, typically on a one-day lag. For additional information on our derivatives and hedging activities, see \\nNote 14 (Derivatives). \\nEquity Securities \\nEquity securities exclude investments that represent a controlling interest in the investee. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values and are predominantly used in our trading activities. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest income. Dividend income from marketable equity securities is recognized in interest income. Nonmarketable equity securities do not have readily \\ndeterminable fair values. These securities are accounted for under one of the following accounting methods: •\\t\\t Fair value through net income: This method is an election. The securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest income; \\n•\\t\\t Equity method: This method is applied when we have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee. The securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of the investee’s earnings or losses, less any dividends received and/or impairments. Equity method adjustments for our share of the investee’s earnings or losses are recognized in other noninterest income and dividends are recognized as a reduction of the investment carrying value; \\n•\\t\\t Proportional amortization method: This method is applied to certain low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. The investments are initially recorded at cost and amortized in proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of the investments and the related tax impacts are recognized in income tax expense; \\n•\\t\\t Cost method: This method is required for specific securities, such as Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan Bank stock. These securities are held at cost less any impairments; \\n•\\t\\t Measurement alternative: This method is followed by all remaining nonmarketable equity securities. These securities are initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value as of the date of an orderly observable transaction of the same or similar security of the same issuer. These securities are also adjusted for impairments. \\nAll realized and unrealized gains and losses, including \\nimpairment losses, from nonmarketable equity securities are \\nrecognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest income. Dividend income from all nonmarketable equity securities, other than equity method securities, is recognized in interest income. \\nOur review for impairment for nonmarketable equity \\nsecurities not carried at fair value includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each security, the intent or requirement to sell the security, the expectations of cash flows, capital needs and the viability of its business model. When the fair value of an equity method or cost method investment is less than its carrying value, we write-down the asset to fair value when we consider declines in value to be other than temporary. When the fair value of an investment accounted for using the measurement alternative is less than its carrying value, we write-down the asset to fair value, without the consideration of anticipated recovery. \\nSee Note 4 (Equity Securities) for additional information. \\nPension Accounting \\nWe sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of Wells\\xa0Fargo. We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans  that provide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to certain eligible employees. We account for our defined benefit pension plans using an actuarial model. Principal assumptions used in determining the net periodic pension cost and the pension obligation include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and projected mortality rates. \\nA single weighted-average discount rate is used to estimate \\nthe present value of our future pension benefit obligations. We \\n \\nWells Fargo & Company 100 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 109}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n determine the discount rate using a yield curve derived from a \\nbroad-based population of high-quality corporate bonds with maturity dates that closely match the estimated timing of the expected benefit payments. \\nOn December 31, 2021, we changed the method used to \\nestimate the interest cost component of pension expense for our principal defined benefit and postretirement plans to the full yield curve approach. The full yield curve approach aligns specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected benefit payment cash flows. This change does not affect the measurement of our pension obligation as the change in interest cost is offset in the actuarial gain (loss). We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in estimate to our pension expense. Previously, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate. We made this change to improve the correlation between the yield curve and the projected benefit payment cash flows. \\nThe determination of our expected long-term rate of return \\non plan assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the current asset allocations and expected returns using forward-looking capital market assumptions. We use the resulting projections to derive a baseline expected rate of return for the Cash Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix. \\nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables \\npublished by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our specific experience. \\nAt year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan \\nliabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting actuarial gain or loss in OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a 5% corridor from AOCI into net periodic pension cost over the estimated average remaining participation period, which at December\\xa031, 2022, is 18 years. See Note 21 (Employee Benefits) for additional information on our pension accounting. \\nIncome Taxes \\nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize.\\xa0An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement.\\xa0Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \\nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \\nmethod and deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. \\nSee Note 22 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for a further description of our provision for income taxes and related income tax assets and liabilities. Stock-Based Compensation \\nOur long-term incentive plans provide awards for employee services in various forms, such as restricted share rights (RSRs) and performance share awards (PSAs). \\nStock-based awards are measured at fair value on the grant \\ndate. The cost is recognized in personnel expense, net of actual forfeitures, in our consolidated statement of income normally over the vesting period of the award; awards with graded vesting are expensed on a straight-line method. Awards to employees who are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to immediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who become retirement eligible before the final vesting date are expensed between the grant date and the date the employee becomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other limited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment ends. \\nPSAs and certain RSRs granted in 2020 included \\ndiscretionary conditions that can result in forfeiture and are measured at fair value initially and subsequently until the discretionary conditions end. For these awards, the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in our stock price. Awards granted in 2022 and 2021 no longer included these discretionary conditions and are not adjusted for subsequent changes in stock price. For PSAs, compensation expense also fluctuates based on the estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions.\\xa0The total expense that will be recognized on these awards is finalized upon the completion of the performance period. \\nFor additional information on our stock-based employee \\ncompensation plans, see Note 12 (Common Stock and Stock Plans). \\nEarnings Per Common Share \\nWe compute earnings per common share by dividing net income applicable to common stock (net income less dividends on preferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over carrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per common share using net income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of common stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are dilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. \\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. \\nWe measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we \\nare required to record them at fair value, when we have elected the fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value measurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to fair value only as required through the application of an accounting method such as LOCOM, write-downs of individual assets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain nonmarketable equity securities. \\nWells Fargo & Company 101 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 110}),\n",

The three levels are as follows: •\\t\\t Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. \\n•\\t\\t Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. \\n•\\t\\t Level 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions that are not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of discounted cash flow models, market comparable pricing, option pricing models, and similar techniques. \\nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to \\nassess the appropriate classification of financial instruments \\nwithin the fair value hierarchy and transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes but is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions. Changes in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will drive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes in availability of observable market data, which also may result in changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause \\nof \\ntransfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The amounts reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. \\nSee Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) for a more \\ndetailed discussion of the valuation methodologies that we apply to our assets and liabilities. \\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information \\nSignificant noncash activities are presented in Table 1.2. \\nTable 1.2: Supplemental Cash Flow Information \\nYear ended December 31, \\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020 \\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities purchased from securitization of LHFS (1) $ 1,506 3,096 21,768 \\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities \\npurchased from securitization of LHFS (1) 745 20,265 9,912 \\nTransfers from loans to LHFS 6,586 19,297 19,975 \\nTransfers from available-for-sale debt securities to held-to-maturity debt securities 50,132 55,993 31,815 \\n(1)\\t\\t Predominantly represents agency mortgage-backed securities purchased upon settlement of the sale and securitization of our conforming residential mortgage loans.

We determine the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by national recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management purposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major credit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated by NRSROs at \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. \\nTable 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt \\nsecurities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities determined to be rated investment grade, inclusive of securities rated based on internal credit grades. \\nWells Fargo & Company 105 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n",

Commercial and industrial loans and lease financing to borrowers in the financials except banks industry represented 15% and 16% of total loans at December 31, 2022 and \\n2021, respectively. At \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have concentrations representing 10% or more of our total loan portfolio in the commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios (real estate mortgage and real estate construction) by state or property type. Residential mortgage loans to borrowers in the state of California represented 12% of total loans at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. These California loans are generally diversified among the larger metropolitan areas in California, with no single area consisting of more than 4% of total loans at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. We continuously monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk management process. Some of our residential mortgage loans include an interest-\\nonly feature as part of the loan terms. These interest-only loans were approximately 2% and 3% of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Substantially all of these interest-only loans at origination were considered to be prime or near prime. We do not offer option adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. \\nWells Fargo & Company 112 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n",

Our commercial lending commitments include, but are not limited to, (i) commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, (ii) financing to customers who warehouse financial assets secured by real estate, consumer, or corporate loans, (iii) financing that is expected to be syndicated or replaced with other forms of long-term financing, and (iv) commercial real estate lending. We also originate multipurpose lending commitments under which commercial customers have the option to draw on the facility in one of several forms, including the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the unfunded commitment amounts of the facility. \\nThe maximum credit risk for these commitments will \\ngenerally be lower than the contractual amount because these commitments may expire without being used or may be cancelled at the customer’s request. We may reduce or cancel lines of credit in accordance with the contracts and applicable law. Certain commitments either provide us with funding discretion or are subject to loan agreements with covenants regarding the financial performance of the customer or borrowing base formulas that must be met before we are required to fund the commitment. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. We do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at our discretion. \\nWe issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in \\npurchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of outstanding issued commercial letters of credit. See Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) for additional information on issued standby letters of credit. We may be a fronting bank, whereby we act as a \\nrepresentative for other lenders, and advance funds or provide for the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated loan or letter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally repaid in less than a week and would normally require default of both the customer and another lender to expose us to loss. \\nThe contractual amount of our unfunded credit \\ncommitments, including unissued letters of credit, is summarized in Table 5.4. The table excludes issued letters of credit and is presented net of commitments syndicated to others, including the fronting arrangements described above. \\nTable 5.4:    Unfunded  Credit C  ommitments  \\n(in  millions) Dec 31,  \\n2022 Dec  31, \\n2021 \\nCommercial  and  industrial $  457,473  388,162\\n\\t  \\nCommercial  real  estate 29,518  31,458\\n\\t  \\nTotal  commercial\\t\\t 486,991  419,620  \\nResidential  mortgage  (1) 39,155  60,439  \\nCredit  card 145,526  130,743  \\nOther  consumer  (2) 69,244  75,919  \\nTotal  consumer\\t\\t 253,925  267,101  \\nTotal  unfunded  credit  commitments $  740,916  686,721  \\n(1)\\t\\t Includes lines of credit totaling $35.5 billion and $45.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\n(2)\\t\\t Primarily includes securities-based lines of credit. \\nWells Fargo & Company 113 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 122}),\n",

The following sections provide the credit quality indicators we most closely monitor. The credit quality indicators are generally based on information as of our financial statement date. \\nCOMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS We manage a \\nconsistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. Commercial loans are generally subject to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings, which is our primary credit quality indicator. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with the criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss categories. \\nTable 5.7 provides the outstanding balances of our \\ncommercial loan portfolio by risk category and credit quality information by origination year for term loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement or if modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). At \\nDecember 31, 2022, we had \\n$532.4 billion and $25.1 billion of pass and criticized commercial loans, respectively. \\nWells Fargo & Company 115 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 124}),\n",

Revolvin          g  \\nloans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual             \\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if modified in a TD            R. \\nWe obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores          \\nare generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited          \\ncircumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit        \\nReporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certai          n  \\nloan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary du             e  \\nto strong collateral and other borrower attributes.        \\nTable 5.9   provides the outstanding balances of our       \\nresidential mortgage loans by our      primary credit quality    \\nindicators.  \\nPayment deferral activities in the residential mortgage        \\nportfolio instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic coul         d  \\ncontinue to delay the recognition of delinquencies for resident         ial  \\nmortgage customers who otherwise would have moved into        \\npast due status.    For additional information on customer      \\naccommodations  in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see        \\nNote 1   (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     ) to Financial    \\nStatements in this Report.    LTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan’s outstanding \\nbalance to the property’s collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) refers to the combination of first lien mortgage and junior lien mortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line products) ratios. We obtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade approach which first uses values provided by automated valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is not available, the original app\\nraised \\nvalue is used. The HPI value is normally the only method considered for high value properties, generally with an original value of $1 million or more, as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we obtain available LTVs and CLTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other institutions. \\nWells Fargo & Company 117 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau guidelines, we do not commence the foreclosure process on residential mortgage loans until after the loan is 120 days delinquent. Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary depending on whether the property address resides in a judicial or non-judicial state. Judicial states require the foreclosure to be processed through the state’s courts while non-judicial states are processed without court intervention. Foreclosure timelines vary according to state law. \\nWells Fargo & Company 121 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 130}),\n",

MSRs may increase upon repurchase due to servicing liabilities associated with these delinquent GNMA loans. \\n(2)\\t\\t Includes sales and transfers of MSRs, which can result in an increase in MSRs if related to portfolios with servicing liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, MSRs decreased $611 million due to the sale of interest-only strips related to excess servicing cash flows from agency residential mortgage-backed securitizations. \\n(3)\\t\\t Includes prepayment rate changes as well as other valuation changes due to changes in mortgage interest rates. To reduce exposure to changes in interest rates, MSRs are economically hedged with derivative instruments. \\n(4)\\t\\t Includes costs to service and unreimbursed foreclosure costs. \\n(5)\\t\\t In 2022, we enhanced our approach for estimating the discount rates to a more dynamic methodology for market curves and volatility, which had a nominal impact. \\n(6)\\t\\t Represents other changes in valuation model inputs or assumptions including prepayment rate estimation changes that are independent of mortgage interest rate changes. \\n(7)\\t\\t Represents the reduction in the MSR fair value for the cash flows expected to be collected during the period, net of income accreted due to the passage of time. \\nTable 6.2   provides key weighted-average assumptions used      \\nin the valuation of residential MSRs and sensitivity of the cur          rent  \\nfair value of residential MSRs to immediate adverse changes in           \\nthose assumptions.

Changes           in  \\nvalue based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be          \\nextrapolated because the relationship of the change in the          \\nassumption to the change in value may not be linear. Also, the             effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the other interests held is calculated independently without changing any other assumptions.

The credit risk related to these advances is limited since the reimbursement is generally senior to cash payments to investors. We also advance payments of taxes and insurance for our owned loans which are collectible from the borrower.

For additional information on our accounting for stock-based compensation plans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). \\nLONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS We have granted restricted share \\nrights (RSRs) and performance share awards (PSAs) as our primary long-term incentive awards. \\nHolders of RSRs and PSAs may be entitled to receive \\nadditional RSRs and PSAs (dividend equivalents) or cash payments equal to the cash dividends that would have been paid had the RSRs or PSAs been issued and outstanding shares of common stock. RSRs and PSAs granted as dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting schedule and conditions as the underlying award. \\nTable 12.2 summarizes the major components of stock \\ncompensation expense and the related recognized tax benefit.

A summary of the status of our RSRs at December 31, 2022, and changes during 2022 is presented in Table 12.3. \\nTable 12.3: Restricted Share Rights \\nNumber Weighted-\\naverage \\ngrant-date \\nfair value \\nNonvested \\nat January 1, 2022 51,604,179 $ 37.98 \\nGranted 24,793,104 51.80 \\nVested (20,380,394) 42.30 \\nCanceled or forfeited (2,779,746) 44.18 \\nNonvested at December 31, 2022 53,237,143 42.44 \\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSRs granted \\nduring 2021 and 2020 was $32.99 and $42.53, respectively. \\nAt December 31, 2022, there was $986 million of total \\nunrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSRs.

PSAs are granted at a target number based on the Company’s performance. The number of awards that vest can be adjusted downward to zero and upward to a maximum of either 125% or 150% of target. The awards vest in the quarter after the end of the performance period. For PSAs whose performance period ended December 31, 2022, the determination of the number of performance shares that will vest will occur in first quarter 2023 after review of the Company’s performance by the Human Resources Committee of the Board. \\nWells Fargo & Company 135 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 144}),\n",

Director Awards \\nWe granted common stock awards to non-employee directors elected or re-elected at the annual meeting of stockholders on April 26, 2022. These stock awards vest immediately. \\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan \\nThe Wells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution plan with an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) feature. We have previously loaned money to the 401(k) Plan to purchase ESOP Preferred Stock that was convertible into common stock over time as the loans were repaid. The Company’s annual contribution to the 401(k) Plan, as well as dividends received on unreleased shares, are used to make payments on the loans. As the loans are repaid, shares are released from the unallocated reserve of the 401(k) Plan. \\nIn October 2022, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our \\nESOP Preferred Stock in exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock. For additional information see Note 11 (Preferred Stock). \\nShares that are not yet released are reflected on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet as unearned ESOP shares. Released common stock is allocated to the 401(k) Plan participants and invested in the Wells Fargo ESOP Fund within the 401(k) Plan. Dividends on the allocated common shares reduce retained earnings, and the shares are considered outstanding for computing earnings per share. Dividends on the unreleased common stock or ESOP Preferred Stock do not reduce retained earnings, and the unreleased shares are not considered to be common stock equivalents for computing earnings per share. \\nTable 12.5 presents the information related to the \\nWells Fargo ESOP Fund and the dividends paid to the 401(k) Plan. \\nTable 12.5: Wells Fargo ESOP Fund \\nDecember 31, \\n(in millions, except shares) 2022 2021 2020 \\nAllocated shares outstanding (common) 152,438,152 149,638,081 155,810,091 \\nUnreleased shares outstanding (common) 10,329,650 — — \\nFair value of unreleased shares outstanding (common) $ 427 — — \\nUnreleased shares outstanding (preferred) — 609,434 822,242 \\nConversion value of unreleased ESOP preferred shares $ — 609 822 \\nFair value of unreleased ESOP preferred shares based on redemption — 700 990 \\nYear ended December 31, \\nDividends paid on (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 \\nAllocated shares (common) $ 134 74 155 \\nUnreleased shares (common) 4 — — \\nUnreleased shares (preferred) 36 66 77 \\nWells Fargo & Company 136 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 145}),\n",

These proceedings and investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related matters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct of investigations of other persons or industry groups. We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those potential losses. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including the matters described below, and the actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions. \\nAUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS On April 20, 2018, the Company \\nentered into consent orders with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to resolve, among other things, investigations by the agencies into the Company’s compliance risk management program and its past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. The consent orders require remediation to customers and the payment of a total of $1.0 billion in civil money penalties to the agencies. In July 2017, the Company announced a plan to remediate customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to automobile CPI policies purchased through a third-party vendor on their behalf. Multiple putative class actions alleging, among other things, unfair and deceptive practices relating to these CPI policies, were filed against the Company and consolidated into one multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlement to resolve the multi-district litigation. Shareholders also filed a putative securities fraud class action against the Company and its executive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions of CPI-related information in the Company’s public disclosures. In January 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants except the Company and a former executive officer and limited the action to two alleged misstatements. Subject to court approval, the parties have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay $300 million to resolve this action. In addition, the Company was subject to a class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that customers were entitled to refunds related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between the customer and dealer and, by assignment, the lender. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlement to resolve the class action. Allegations related to the CPI and GAP programs were among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, which has been dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, investigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues related to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer auto loans, including related insurance products. On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. The consent order requires, among other things, remediation to customers and the payment of a $1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve investigations by state attorneys general. \\nCOMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION In October and \\nNovember 2020, plaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud class actions, which were consolidated into one lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company and certain of its current and former officers made false and misleading statements or omissions regarding, among other things, the Company’s commercial lending underwriting practices, the credit quality of its commercial credit portfolios, and the value of its commercial loans, collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. In May 2022, the district court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In January 2023, the parties voluntarily dismissed the appeal. \\nCOMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS Federal government agencies, \\nincluding the United States Department of Labor (Department of Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with the Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve the Department of Labor’s review. On September 26, 2022, participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with certain of these transactions. \\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells Fargo \\nshareholders have brought a putative securities fraud class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the Company and certain of its current and former executive officers and directors made false or misleading statements regarding the Company’s efforts to comply with the February 2018 consent order with the Federal Reserve Board and the April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC. Allegations related to the Company’s efforts to comply with these three consent orders are also among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in California state court. \\nCONSUMER DEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY \\nINVESTIGATIONS The CFPB has undertaken an investigation into \\nwhether customers were unduly harmed by the Company’s \\nhistorical practices associated with the freezing (and, in many cases, closing) of consumer deposit accounts after the Company \\nWells Fargo & Company 137 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 146}),\n",

The CFPB has also undertaken an investigation into certain of the Company’s past disclosures to customers regarding the minimum qualifying debit card usage required for customers to receive a waiver of monthly service fees on certain consumer deposit accounts. As described above, on December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. \\nHIRING PRACTICES MATTERS Government agencies, including the \\nUnited States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. A putative securities fraud class action has also been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company and certain of its executive officers made false or misleading statements about the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. Allegations related to the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity are also among the subjects of shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. \\nINTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and individual merchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and Wachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks damages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately $6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior class counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, 2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the money damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately $5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and $900 million in additional funding. The Company’s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is approximately $94.5 million. The court granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. Several of the opt-out and direct action litigations have been settled while others remain pending. \\nMORTGAGE LENDING MATTERS Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmortgage borrowers filed separate putative class actions alleging that Wells Fargo improperly denied mortgage loan modifications or repayment plans to customers in the foreclosure process due to the overstatement of foreclosure attorneys’ fees that were included for purposes of determining whether a customer in the foreclosure process qualified for a mortgage loan modification or repayment plan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into settlements to resolve the class actions, while the others were voluntarily dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding these and other mortgage servicing matters. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company regarding loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business and insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order. In addition, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. As described above, on December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. \\nNOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION In August \\n2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (Nomura) and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform default oversight duties. In March 2022, Wells Fargo entered into an agreement to settle the six actions filed by Nomura, and the actions have been voluntarily dismissed. In the remaining action filed by Natixis, Wells Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of its \\nWells Fargo & Company 138 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 147}),\n",

In January 2023, Natixis \\nand Wells Fargo reached an agreement in principle to settle their respective claims. \\nOFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION The Company has self-identified \\nan issue whereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo software-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related financing transactions with countries and entities prohibited by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury. We do not believe any funds related to these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as a result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company has made voluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and has been cooperating with investigations or inquiries arising out of this matter by federal government agencies. The Company is in resolution discussions with certain of these agencies, although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. \\nRECORD-KEEPING INVESTIGATIONS The United States Securities \\nand Exchange Commission and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission have undertaken investigations regarding the Company’s compliance with records retention requirements relating to business communications sent over unapproved electronic messaging channels. \\nRETAIL SALES PRACTICES MATTERS Federal and state government \\nagencies, including the United States Department of Justice (Department of Justice) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. On February 21, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve the Department of Justice’s criminal investigation into the Company’s retail sales practices as well as a separate agreement to resolve the Department of Justice’s civil investigation. As part of the Department of Justice criminal settlement, no charges will be filed against the Company provided the Company abides by all the terms of the agreement. The Department of Justice criminal settlement also includes the Company’s agreement that the facts set forth in the settlement document constitute sufficient facts for the finding of criminal violations of statutes regarding bank records and personal information. On February 21, 2020, the Company also entered into an order to resolve the SEC’s investigation arising out of the Company’s retail sales practices. The SEC order contains a finding, to which the Company consented, that the facts set forth include violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. As part of the resolution of the Department of Justice and SEC investigations, the Company made payments totaling $3.0 billion. The Company has also entered into agreements to resolve other government agency investigations, including investigations by the state attorneys general. In addition, a number of lawsuits were filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into various settlements to resolve these lawsuits. \\nRMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF \\nLimited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light’s claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Company previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation. \\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended to include three individual current and former beneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. Wells Fargo filed a petition to remove the case to federal court, but the case was remanded back to state court. \\nOUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period. \\nWells Fargo & Company 139 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",

We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation trading or other purposes. \\nRisk Management Derivatives \\nOur asset/liability management approach to interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of derivatives, which are typically designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, or economic hedges. We use derivatives to help minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, foreign currency and other exposures, which may cause the hedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows and earnings. In a fair value or economic hedge, the effect of change in fair value will generally be offset by the unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where we manage the variability of cash payments due to interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives linked to hedged assets and liabilities, the hedged asset or liability is not adjusted and the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income. Customer Accommodation Trading \\nWe also use various derivatives, including interest rate, commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, as an accommodation to our customers as part of our trading businesses. These derivative transactions, which involve engaging in market-making activities or acting as an intermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers manage their market risks. We usually offset our exposure from such derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such as separate derivative or security transactions. These customer accommodations and any offsetting derivatives are treated as customer accommodation trading and other derivatives in our disclosures. Additionally, embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contracts are included in the customer accommodation trading and other derivatives disclosures, as applicable. \\nWells Fargo & Company 140 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 149}),\n",

For additional information on Trading Activities, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). \\nBalance Sheet Offsetting \\nWe execute substantially all of our derivative transactions under \\nmaster netting arrangements. Where legally enforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. We reflect all derivative balances and related cash collateral subject to enforceable master netting arrangements on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not net non-cash collateral that we receive or pledge against derivative balances on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nFor disclosure purposes, we present “Total Derivatives, net” \\nwhich represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each counterparty after considering the balance sheet netting adjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative exposure by monitoring the credit risk associated with each counterparty using counterparty-specific credit risk limits, using master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral. Table 14.2 provides information on the fair values of \\nderivative assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, the balance sheet netting adjustments and the resulting net fair value amount recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral associated with such arrangements. In addition to the netting amounts included in the table, we also have balance sheet netting related to resale and repurchase agreements that are disclosed within Note 18 (Pledged Assets and Collateral). \\nWells Fargo & Company 141 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 150}),\n",

We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap contracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical commodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against changes in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 24 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain interest-earning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial loans, and interest paid on certain floating-rate debt due to changes in the contractually specified interest rate. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates. \\nWe estimate $695 million pre-tax of deferred net losses \\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at December 31, 2022, will be reclassified into net interest income during the next twelve months. For cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2022, we are hedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of 10 years. For additional information on our accounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). \\nWells Fargo & Company 142 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 151}),\n",

We also use economic hedge derivatives to mitigate the periodic earnings volatility caused by mismatches between the changes in fair value of the hedged item and hedging instrument recognized on our fair value accounting hedges. Changes in the fair values of derivatives used to economically hedge the deferred compensation plan are reported in personnel expense. \\nMortgage Banking Activities \\nWe use economic hedge derivatives in our mortgage banking          \\nbusiness to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of  \\n           \\n(1) \\xa0certain residential MSRs measured at fair value, (2) residentia         l  \\nmortgage LHFS, (3) derivative loan commitments, and (4) other          \\ninterests held. The types of derivatives used include swaps,          swaptions, constant maturity mortgages, forwards, Eurodollar       and Treasury futures and options contracts. Loan commitments         for mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered           derivatives. Residential MSRs, derivative loan commitments,       certain residential mortgage LHFS, and our economic hedge         derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair valu           e  included in mortgage banking noninterest income. See        Note 6   (Mortgage Banking Activities   ) for additional information on this       economic hedging activity and mortgage banking income.       Customer Accommodation Trading and Other For customer accommodation trading purposes, we use swaps, futures, forwards, spots and options to assist our customers in managing their own risks, including interest rate, commodity, equity, foreign exchange, and credit contracts. These derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also enter into derivatives for risk management that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. \\nCustomer accommodation trading and other derivatives also \\ninclude embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contract. We periodically issue hybrid long-term notes and certificates of deposit (CDs) where the performance of the hybrid instrument note is linked to an equity, commodity or currency index, or basket of such indices. These notes contain explicit terms that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the note in a manner similar to a derivative instrument and therefore are considered to contain an “embedded” derivative instrument. The indices on which the performance of the hybrid instrument is calculated are not clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The “embedded” derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative. Additionally, we may invest in hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives, such as credit derivatives, that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract. In such instances, we either elect fair value option for the hybrid instrument or separate the embedded derivative from the host contract and account for the host contract and derivative separately. \\nWells Fargo & Company 145 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 154}),\n",

We generally use credit derivatives to assist customers with their risk management objectives by purchasing and selling credit protection on corporate debt obligations through the use of credit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help manage counterparty exposure. We would be required to perform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of default by the referenced obligors. Events of default include events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of principal and/or interest payment. \\nTable 14.7 provides details of sold credit derivatives. \\nTable 14.7: Sold Credit Derivatives \\nNotional amount \\n(in millions) Protection sold Protection  sold  –  \\nnon-investment  \\ngrade \\nDecember 31, 2022 \\nCredit default swaps $ 12,733 1,860 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,728 6,518 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 19,461 8,378 \\nDecember 31, 2021 Credit default swaps $ 8,033 1,982 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,756 6,012 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 14,789 7,994 \\nProtection sold represents the estimated maximum \\nexposure to loss that would be incurred if, upon an event of \\ndefault, the value of our interests and any associated collateral declined to zero, and does not take into consideration any of recovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from collateral held or any economic hedges. \\nThe amounts under non-investment grade represent the \\nnotional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a higher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the credit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets. We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets \\nunder the credit derivative have an external rating that is investment grade. If an external rating is not available, we classify the credit derivative as non-investment grade. \\nOur maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is \\nmanaged through posted collateral and purchased credit derivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order to achieve our desired credit risk profile. The credit risk management is designed to provide an ability to recover a significant portion of any amounts that would be paid under sold credit derivatives. \\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features \\nCertain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand additional collateral or require termination or replacement of derivative instruments in a net liability position. Table 14.8 illustrates our exposure to OTC bilateral derivative contracts with credit-risk contingent features, collateral we have posted, and the additional collateral we would be required to post if the credit rating of our debt was downgraded below investment grade. \\nTable 14.8: Credit-Risk Contingent Features \\n(in  billions) Dec 31,  \\n2022 Dec  31, \\n2021 \\nNet  derivative  liabilities  with  credit-risk  \\ncontingent  features $  20.7  12.2  \\nCollateral  posted 17.4  11.0  \\nAdditional  collateral  to  be  posted  upon  a  below  \\ninvestment  grade  credit  rating  (1) 3.3  1.2   \\n  \\n  \\n(1) Any credit rating below investment grade requires us to post the maximum amount of collateral. \\nWells Fargo & Company 147 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 15.1 in this Note. Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We provide in Table 15.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities carried at amortized cost. \\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We classify our assets and liabilities \\nrecorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed description of the fair value hierarchy. \\nIn the determination of the classification of financial \\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nWe do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \\nfair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy. \\nAssets \\nTRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded \\nat fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are valued using internal trader prices that are subject to independent price verification procedures, which includes comparing internal trader prices against multiple independent pricing sources, such as prices obtained from third-party pricing services, observed trades, and other approved market data. These pricing services compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no price is observable. We review pricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine if observable market information is being used versus unobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an internal trader price, compared with other independent pricing sources, considerations include the range and quality of available information and observability of trade data. These sources are used to evaluate the reasonableness of a trader price; however, valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from knowledge of a particular market. Substantially all of our trading debt securities are recorded using internal trader prices. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various sources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices in active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such securities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing services and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from independent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. Substantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using vendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note for additional discussion of our processes when using vendor prices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes those classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. \\nWhen vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be \\nadjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also use internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal models use discounted cash flow techniques or market comparable pricing techniques. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS) LHFS generally includes \\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the securitization or whole loan market. A majority of residential LHFS, and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our trading business, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS that are not part of our trading business is based on quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. We may use securitization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization activities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market conditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading business is based on pending transactions when available. Where market pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. \\nLOANS Although loans are recorded at amortized cost, we record \\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect write-downs that are based on the observable market price of the loan or current appraised value of the collateral less costs to sell. \\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs) Residential MSRs are \\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis. Commercial MSRs are carried at LOCOM and may be written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. We determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that estimates the present value of expected future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants may use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of prepayment speeds (including housing price volatility for residential MSRs), discount rates, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. \\nDERIVATIVES Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis.

The fair val            ue of   \\nother  derivatives, which   predominantly  relate to derivatives    \\ntraded in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, are measured using         \\ninternal valuation techniques, as quoted market prices are not          \\nreadily available. These instruments are classified as Level 2          or  \\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy, depending on the significa           nce  \\nof unobservable inputs in the valuation. Valuation techniques a        nd  \\ninputs to internal models depend on the type of derivative and            \\nnature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the va            lue  \\nof the derivative is based. Key inputs can include yield curves          ,  \\ncredit curves, foreign exchange rates, prepayment rates,        \\nvolatility measurements and correlation of certain of these         \\ninputs.  \\nEQUITY SECURITIES Marketable equity securities and certain \\nnonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account \\nfor at fair value are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Our remaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for using the equity method, cost method or measurement alternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying value of equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence of orderly observable transactions of the same or similar securities of the same issuer. \\nWe use quoted prices to determine the fair value of \\nmarketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded. Quoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable equity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally market comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value for such securities. We use all available information in making this determination, which includes observable transaction prices for the same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing services, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public companies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, we make adjustments to observed market data to reflect the comparative differences between the market data and the attributes of our equity security, such as differences with public companies and other investment-specific considerations like liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the instruments. \\nOTHER ASSETS Although other assets are generally recorded at \\namortized cost, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairments or the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease ROU assets, foreclosed assets and physical commodities. Fair value is generally based upon independent market prices or appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a discounted cash flow model. \\nLiabilities \\nSHORT-SALE TRADING LIABILITIES Short-sale trading liabilities in \\nour trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets, where available. When quoted prices for the same instruments are not available or markets are not active, fair values are estimated using recent trades of similar securities. \\nLONG-TERM DEBT Although long-term debt is generally recorded \\nat amortized cost, we have elected the fair value option for certain structured notes issued by our trading business. Fair values for these instruments are estimated using a discounted cash flow model that includes both the embedded derivative and debt portions of the notes. The discount rate used in these discounted cash flow models also incorporates the impact of our credit spread, which is based on observable spreads in the secondary bond market. \\nLevel 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes \\nWe generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internal models and, to a lesser extent, prices obtained from vendors. Our valuation processes vary depending on which approach is utilized. \\nINTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS Certain Level 3 fair value \\nestimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash flow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the inputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable inputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic performance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be implied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to historical experience and other third-party data where available. \\nInternal models are subject to review prescribed within our \\nmodel risk management policies and procedures, which include model validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are appropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, including reviewing its key components, such as inputs, processing components, logic or theory, output results and supporting model documentation. Validation also includes ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate given observable market transactions or other market data within the same or similar asset classes. We also have ongoing monitoring procedures in place for our Level 3 assets and liabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models continue to perform as expected, include: • ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions   \\n      \\nand other independent market data (including pricing        \\nvendors, if available);   \\n•\\t\\t back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized transactions; and \\n•\\t\\t review of modeled valuation results against expectations, including review of significant or unusual fluctuations in value. \\nWe update model inputs and methodologies periodically to \\nreflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing \\nmodels are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full mode\\nl \\nrevalidations as necessary. \\nInternal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by \\nthe appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function and monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management. Independent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function, provides independent oversight of model risk management, and its responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review, and monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing periodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk Committee. \\nVENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS We routinely obtain pricing \\nfrom third-party vendors to value our assets or liabilities. In certain limited circumstances, this includes assets and liabilities that we classify as Level 3. We have processes in place to approve and periodically review third-party vendors to assess whether information obtained and valuation techniques used are appropriate.

Option models estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return.  \\nThe unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are \\nthose we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if by their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liabi\\nlity \\nwould be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We also consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs used within the valuation. Following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. •\\t\\t Comparability adjustment   – is an adjustment made to       \\nobserved market data, such as a transaction price to reflect           \\ndissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or ot        her  \\nfactors used within a market valuation approach, expressed         \\nas a percentage of an observed price.       \\n•\\t\\t Conversion factor   – is the risk-adjusted rate in which a    \\nparticular instrument may be exchanged for another instrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage change from a specified rate. \\n•\\t\\t Correlation factor   – is the likelihood of one instrument   \\nchanging in price relative to another based on an established relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time. \\n•\\t\\t Cost to service    – is the expected cost per loan of servicing a  \\nportfolio of loans, which includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing such loan portfolios. \\n•\\t\\t Default rate   – is an estimate of the likelihood of not   \\ncollecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a constant default rate (CDR). \\n•\\t\\t Discount rate   – is a rate of return used to calculate the  \\npresent value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at the fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium \\ncomponent. The benchmark rate component, for example, OIS, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or U.S. Treasury rates, is generally observable within the market and is necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money. The risk premium component reflects the amount of compensation market participants require due to the         \\nuncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting         \\nfrom risks such as credit and liquidity.       \\n• Fall-out factor  \\n  – is the expected percentage of loans        \\nassociated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio         \\nthat are likely of not funding.      \\n• Initial-value servicing   – is the estimated value of the        \\nunderlying loan, including the value attributable to the         \\nembedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of         \\noutstanding unpaid principal balance.    \\n• Loss severity   – is the estimated percentage of contractual        \\ncash flows lost in the event of a default.         \\n• Multiples  – are financial ratios of comparable public        \\ncompanies, such as ratios of enterprise value or market value           \\nof equity to earnings before interest, depreciation, and         \\namortization (EBITDA), revenue, net income or book value,         \\nadjusted to reflect dissimilarities in operational, financial,        or  \\nmarketability to the comparable public company used in a          \\nmarket valuation approach.   \\n• Prepayment rate   – is the estimated rate at which forecasted         \\nprepayments of principal of the related loan or debt          \\ninstrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant          \\nprepayment rate (CPR).   \\n• Volatility factor   – is the extent of change in price an item is            \\nestimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time          \\nexpressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a            \\nperiod over time.   \\n• Weighted average life    – is the weighted average number of        \\nyears an investment is expected to remain outstanding         \\nbased on its expected cash flows reflecting the estimated          \\ndate the issuer will call or extend the maturity of the            \\ninstrument or otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing          \\nof an instrument’s cash flows whose timing is not          \\ncontractually fixed.  \\nInterrelationships and Uncertainty of Inputs Used in \\nRecurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements \\nUsage of the valuation techniques presented in Table 15.3 requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some of which represent significant unobservable inputs. Accordingly, changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. \\nCertain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a \\ndirectionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. Where multiple inputs are used within the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change in another input having a potentially muted impact to the overall fair value of that particular instrument. Additionally, a change in one unobservable input may result in a change to another unobservable input (that is, changes in certain inputs are interrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify the fair value impact. \\nDEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE The internal models \\nused to determine fair value for these Level 3 instruments use certain significant unobservable inputs within a discounted cash flow or market comparable pricing valuation technique. Such inputs include discount rate, prepayment rate, default rate, loss severity, multiples, and comparability adjustment. \\nThese Level 3 assets would decrease (increase) in value \\nbased upon an increase (decrease) in discount rate, default rate or loss severity inputs and would generally decrease (increase) in \\nWells Fargo & Company 153 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 162}),\n",

The comparability adjustment input may have a positive or negative impact on fair value depending on the change in fair value of the item the comparability adjustment references. \\nGenerally, a change in the assumption used for the default \\nrate is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the risk premium component of the discount rate (specifically, the portion related to credit risk) and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable inputs for comparability adjustment, multiples, and loss severity do not increase or decrease based on movements in the other significant unobservable inputs for these Level 3 assets. \\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS The discounted cash flow models \\nused to determine fair value of Level 3 MSRs utilize certain significant unobservable inputs including prepayment rate, discount rate and costs to service. An increase in any of these unobservable inputs will reduce the fair value of the MSRs and alternatively, a decrease in any one of these inputs would result in the MSRs increasing in value. Generally, a decrease in discount rates increases the value of MSRs, unless accompanied by a related update to our prepayment rates. The cost to service assumption generally does not increase or decrease based on movements in the discount rate or the prepayment rate. The sensitivity of our residential MSRs is discussed further in Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities). \\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Level 3 derivative instruments are \\nvalued using market comparable pricing, option pricing and discounted cash flow valuation techniques which use certain unobservable inputs to determine fair value. Such inputs consist of prepayment rate, default rate, loss severity, initial-value servicing, fall-out factor, volatility factor, weighted average life, conversion factor, and correlation factor. \\nLevel 3 derivative assets (liabilities) where we are long the \\nunderlying would decrease (increase) in value upon an increase (decrease) in default rate, fall-out factor, conversion factor, or loss severity inputs. Conversely, Level 3 derivative assets (liabilities) would generally increase (decrease) in value upon an increase (decrease) in prepayment rate, initial-value servicing, \\nweighted average life or volatility factor inputs. The inverse \\nof \\nthe above relationships would occur for instruments when we are short the underlying. The correlation factor input may have a positive or negative impact on the fair value of derivative instruments depending on the change in fair value of the item the correlation factor references. \\nGenerally, for derivative instruments for which we are \\nsubject to changes in the value of the underlying referenced instrument, a change in the assumption used for default rate is accompanied by directionally similar change in the risk premium component of the discount rate (specifically, the portion relat\\ned \\nto credit risk) and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable inputs for loss severity, initial-value servicing, fall-out factor, volatility factor, weighted average life, conversion factor, and correlation factor do not increase or decrease based on movements in other significant unobservable inputs for these Level 3 instruments. \\nNONMARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES Level 3 nonmarketable \\nequity securities are valued using a market comparable pricing valuation technique, with a comparability adjustment as the single significant unobservable input. The comparability adjustment input may have a positive or negative impact on fair value depending on the change in fair value of the item the comparability adjustment references. \\nAssets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \\nWe may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of LOCOM accounting, write-downs of individual assets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain nonmarketable equity securities. \\nTable 15.4 provides the fair value hierarchy and fair value at \\nthe date of the nonrecurring fair value adjustment for all assets that were still held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during the years then ended. \\nTable 15.4:    Fair Va  lue o n a   Nonrecurring Ba  sis  \\n  December 31, 2022   December 31, 2021 \\n (in millions)  \\xa0 Level 2  \\xa0 Level 3 \\xa0 Total  \\xa0 Level 2  \\xa0 Level 3 \\xa0 Total \\n    Loans held for sale (1)  $  838  554  1,392  3,911  1,407  5,318 \\nLoans: \\nCommercial 285 — 285 476 — 476 \\nConsumer 512 — 512 380 — 380 \\nTotal loans 797 — 797 856 — 856      \\n            \\n            \\n             \\n   Mortgage servicing rights (commercial)  —  75  75  —  567  567 \\n  Nonmarketable equity securities  1,926  2,818  4,744  6,262  765  7,027 \\n Other assets  1,862  296  2,158  1,373  175  1,548 \\n        Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $  5,423   3,743  9,166  12,402  2,914  15,316 \\n(1) Predominantly consists of commercial mortgages and residential mortgage – first lien loans. \\nTable 15.5 presents the gains (losses) on certain assets held \\nat the end of the reporting periods presented for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recognized in earnings during the respective periods. \\nWells Fargo & Company 154 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 163}),\n",

We may elect the fair value option to align the measurement model with how the financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce complexity or accounting asymmetry. Following is a discussion of the portfolios for which we elected the fair value option. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS) LHFS measured at fair value include \\nresidential mortgage loan originations for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist to reliably support our valuations. Loan origination fees on these loans are recorded when earned, and related direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred. We believe fair value measurement for LHFS reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. \\nAdditionally we purchase loans for market-making purposes \\nto support the buying and selling demands of our customers in our trading business. These loans are generally held for a short period of time and managed within parameters of internally approved market risk limits. Fair value measurement best aligns with our risk management practices. Fair value for these loans is generally determined using readily available market data based on recent transaction prices for similar loans. \\nLONG-TERM DEBT We have elected to account for certain \\nstructured debt liabilities under the fair value option. These exposures relate to our trading activities and fair value accounting better aligns with our risk management practices and reduces complexity. \\nFor long-term debt carried at fair value, the change in fair \\nvalue attributable to instrument-specific credit risk is recorded in OCI and all other changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. \\nTable 15.7 reflects differences between the fair value \\ncarrying amount of the assets \\nand liabilities for which we have \\nelected the fair value option and the contractual aggregate unpaid principal amount at maturity. \\nTable 15.7: Fair Value Option \\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 \\n(in  millions) Fair valu  e  \\ncarry\\ning  \\namount Aggregate \\nu\\nnpaid \\nprincipal Fair valu  e  \\ncarry\\ning \\namount less \\xa0  \\naggregate \\nunpaid \\nprincipal Fair  value  \\ncarrying \\n \\namount Aggregate  \\nunpaid \\n \\nprincipal Fair  value  \\ncarrying \\n \\namount \\xa0less  \\naggregate \\nunpaid \\nprincipal \\nLoans held for sale   (1) $  4,220   4,614  (394)  15,895  15,750  145 \\n Long-term debt  (1,346)  (1,775)  429  —  —  — \\n(1) Nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing included in LHFS for which we have elected the fair value option were insignificant at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \\nTable 15.8   reflects amounts included in earnings      related to   \\ninitial  measurement and subsequent changes in fair value, by         \\nincome statement line item, for assets and liabilities for whic          h  the fair value option was elected     .

Credit spread is the market yield on the loans less the relevant risk-free benchmark interest rate. For nonperforming loans, we attribute all changes in fair value to instrument-specific credit risk. For LHFS accounted for under the fair value option, instrument-specific credit gains or losses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were insignificant. For long-term debt, instrument-specific credit risk gains or \\nlosses represent the impact of changes in fair value due to changes in our credit spread and are derived using observable secondary bond market information. These impacts are recorded in OCI.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans transferred to a VIE by a third party. \\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which may include: •\\t\\t underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently making markets in those securities; \\n•\\t\\t providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; \\n•\\t\\t entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; \\n•\\t\\t holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \\n•\\t\\t acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \\n•\\t\\t providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \\n•\\t\\t providing seller financing to VIEs. \\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity \\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan sale transactions. \\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the normal \\ncourse of business we sell originated and purchased residential \\nand commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant to the VIE. \\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \\nloan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and \\n2020, we repurchased loans of \\n$2.2 billion, $4.6 billion, and $30.3 billion, respectively, which predominantly represented repurchases of government insured loans. We recorded assets and related liabilities of $743 million and $107 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, where we did not exercise our option to repurchase eligible loans. \\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual representations and warranties as well as other recourse arrangements. At December 31, 2022 and \\n2021, our liability for \\nthese repurchase and recourse arrangements was $167 million and $173 million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $13.8 billion and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nSubstantially all residential servicing activity is related to \\nassets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred loans, account for the transfers as sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We also typically retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, such as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our servicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer and the most significant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. \\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell whole loans to \\nVIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs. \\nTable 16.1 presents information about transfers of assets during \\nthe periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as sales and have continuing involvement with the transferred assets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds and recorded servicing assets, securities, and loans. Each of these interests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are classified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are classified as Level 2. Substantially all transfers were related to residential mortgage securitizations with the GSEs or GNMA and resulted in \\nno gain or loss because the loans are measured at fair \\nvalue on a recurring basis. Additionally, we may transfer certain government insured loans that we previously repurchased.

For the same period, we received $9.9 billion in proceeds from the sales and recognized $355 million of gains, which are included in other noninterest income on our consolidated statement of income. In connection with the sales, we provided $3.8 billion of collateralized loan financing to a third-party sponsored VIE, and received cash flows of $3.8 billion which fully repaid these loans. We do not consolidate the VIE as we do not have power over the significant activities of the entity. RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization \\ntransactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers. In resecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This activity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the resecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-making power with third parties and do not hold significant economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making activities. We transferred $17.0 billion, $39.6 billion, and $77.2 billion of securities to resecuritization VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts are not included in Table 16.1. Related total VIE assets were $112.0 billion and $117.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held $793 million and $817 million of securities, respectively, of which $428 million and $607 million related to resecuritizations transacted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nWells Fargo & Company 159 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 168}),\n",

Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations also include commercial mortgage loan securitizations sponsored by third parties where we did not originate or transfer the loans but serve as master servicer and invest in securities that could be potentially significant to the VIE. \\nConforming loan securitization and resecuritization \\ntransactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table 16.4 \\nbecause we are not the sponsor or we do not have \\npower over the activities most significant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to the nature of the guarantees provided by the GSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with these VIEs is limited. For additional information about conforming mortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the “Loan Sales and Securitization Activity” and “Resecuritization Activities” sections within this Note. \\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased \\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to VIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We may also acquire such beneficial interests in transactions where we do not act as a transferor. We own all of the beneficial interests and may also service the underlying mortgages that serve as collateral to the bonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing and workout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore we do not have control over the key decisions of the VIEs. \\nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES We engage in various forms of \\nstructured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including asset-backed finance structures and other securitizations collateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral may include rental properties, asset-backed securities, student loans and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or marketing the arrangements as well as provide financing, service one or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives with the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We are not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we do not have power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs. Table 16.4 provides a summary of our exposure to the unconsolidated VIEs described above, which includes investments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity agreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude certain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our continuing involvement is temporary or administrative in nature or insignificant in size. \\nIn Table 16.4, “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining \\nprincipal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the most current information available. “Carrying value” is the amount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. “Maximum exposure to loss” is determined as the carrying value of our investment in the VIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase options that have not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn liquidity and lending commitments, the notional amount of net written derivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or stressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. \\nDebt, guarantees and other commitments include amounts \\nrelated to lending arrangements, liquidity agreements, and certain loss sharing obligations associated with loans originated, sold, and serviced under certain GSE programs. \\n“Maximum exposure to loss” represents estimated loss that \\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for which we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure is not an indication of expected loss. \\nWells Fargo & Company 160 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 169}),\n",

The projects are typically managed by third-party sponsors who have the power over the VIE’s assets, therefore, we do not consolidate the VIEs. The carrying value of our equity investments in tax credit VIEs was $18.7 billion and $17.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also had loans to tax credit VIEs with a carrying value of $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nOur maximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, was $28.0 billion and $24.7 billion, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss included total unfunded equity and lending commitments of $7.3 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) for additional information about unfunded capital commitments. Our affordable housing equity investments qualify for the \\nlow-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). For these investments we are periodically required to provide additional financial support during the investment period, or at the discretion of project sponsors. A liability is recognized for unfunded commitments that are both legally binding and probable of funding. These commitments are predominantly funded within \\nthree years \\nof initial investment. Our liability for affordable \\nhousing equity investment unfunded commitments was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2022, and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2021, and was included in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nTable 16.5 summarizes the amortization of our LIHTC \\ninvestments and the related tax credits and other tax benefits that are recognized in income tax expense/(benefit) on our consolidated statement of income. \\nTable 16.5: LIHTC Investments \\nYear  ended  December  31,\\n (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 \\n   Proportional \\namortization of investments $  1,549 1,545  1,407 \\n     Tax credits and other tax benefits (1,834) (1,783) (1,639)\\n      Net expense/(benefit) recognized within income tax expense $ (285) (238) (232) \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\nWells Fargo & Company 161 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 170}),\n",

We are the primary beneficiary of the following structure types: \\nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES We may \\nsecuritize dealer floor plan loans in a revolving master trust entity. As servicer and residual interest holder, we control the key decisions of the trust and consolidate the entity. The total VIE assets held by the master trust represent a majority of the total VIE assets presented for this category in Table 16.6. In a separate transaction structure, we may provide the majority of debt and equity financing to an SPE that engages in lending and leasing to specific vendors and service the underlying collateral. \\nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES Other VIEs are predominantly related to \\nmunicipal tender option bond (MTOB) transactions. MTOBs are vehicles to finance the purchase of municipal bonds through the issuance of short-term debt to investors. Our involvement with MTOBs includes serving as the residual interest holder, which provides control over the key decisions of the VIE, as well as the remarketing agent or liquidity provider related to the debt issued to investors. We may also securitize nonconforming mortgage \\nloans, in which our involvement includes servicer of the underlying assets and holder of subordinate or senior securitie\\ns \\nissued by the VIE. During second quarter 2022, we purchased the outstanding mortgage loans from the VIEs and extinguished the related debt associated with such securitizations. \\nTable 16.6 presents a summary of financial assets and liabilities \\nof our consolidated VIEs. The carrying value represents assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. “Total VIE assets” includes affiliate balances that are eliminated upon consolidation, and therefore in some instances will differ from the carrying value of assets. \\nOn our consolidated balance sheet, we separately disclose \\n(1) the consolidated assets of certain VIEs that can only be used to settle the liabilities of those VIEs, and (2) the consolidated liabilities of certain VIEs for which the VIE creditors do not have recourse to Wells Fargo. \\nTable 16.6: Transactions with Consolidated VIEs \\nCarrying value – asset (liability) \\n(in millions) Total \\nVIE assets Loans Debt \\nsecurities All other \\nassets (1) Long-term \\ndebt All other \\nliabilities  (2) \\nDecember 31, 2022 \\nCommercial and industrial loans and leases $ 7,148 4,802 — 190 — (129) \\nOther 72 — 71 1 — (72) \\nTotal consolidated VIEs $ 7,220 4,802 71 191 — (201) \\nDecember 31, 2021 Commercial and industrial loans and leases $ 7,013 4,099 — 231 — (188) \\nOther 516 377 71 3 (149) (71) \\nTotal consolidated VIEs $ 7,529 4,476 71 234 (149) (259) \\n(1) All other assets includes cash and due from banks, and other assets. \\n(2) All other liabilities includes short-term borrowings, and accrued expenses and other liabilities. \\nOther Transactions \\nIn addition to the transactions included in the previous tables, we \\nhave used wholly-owned trust preferred security VIEs to issue debt securities or preferred equity exclusively to third-party investors. As the sole assets of the VIEs are receivables from us, we do not consolidate the VIEs even though we own all of the voting equity shares of the VIEs, have fully guaranteed the obligations of the VIEs, and may have the right to redeem the third-party securities under certain circumstances. On our consolidated balance sheet, we reported the debt securities issued to the VIEs as long-term junior subordinated debt.

As the agreements that include these guarantees automatically renew annually, we believe presentation of \\nthese amounts within the expires in one year or less category better aligns with the committed term. \\n(4)\\t\\t Includes indemnifications provided to certain third-party clearing agents. Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $157 million and $216 million with related collateral of $1.3 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss \\nthat would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical circumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table 17.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying value is more representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if applicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit risk of the related contingent obligation. \\nFor our guarantees in Table 17.1, non-investment grade \\nrepresents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of performance under the terms of the guarantee, which is determined based on an external rating or an internal credit grade that is below investment grade. \\nSTANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue standby letters of credit, \\nwhich include performance and financial guarantees, for customers in connection with contracts between our customers and third parties. Standby letters of credit are conditional lending commitments where we are obligated to make payment to a third party on behalf of a customer if the customer fails to meet their contractual obligations. Total maximum exposure to loss includes the portion of multipurpose lending facilities for which we have issued standby letters of credit under the commitments. \\nDIRECT PAY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue direct pay letters of \\ncredit to serve as credit enhancements for certain bond issuances. Beneficiaries (bond trustees) may draw upon these instruments to make scheduled principal and interest payments, redeem all outstanding bonds because a default event has occurred, or for other reasons as permitted by the agreement. \\nWRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency \\noptions and over-the-counter written equity put options that are derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. Written put options give the counterparty the right to sell to us an underlying instrument held by the counterparty at a specified price by a specified date. While these derivative transactions expose us to risk if the option is exercised, we manage this risk by entering into offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the underlying instrument. We offset market risk related to options written to customers with cash securities or other offsetting derivative transactions. Additionally, for certain of these contracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying instrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. The fair value of written options represents our view of the probability that we will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value of these written options was a liability of $15 million, and an asset of $280 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value may be an asset as a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these derivative contracts. At December 31, 2022, the maximum exposure to loss was $23.4 billion, with $21.3 billion expiring in three years or less compared with $17.2 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021.

We provide recourse, predominantly to GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. Substantially all of these programs and arrangements require that we share in the loans’ credit exposure for their remaining life by providing recourse to the GSE, up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-rata basis in the event of borrower default. Under the remaining recourse programs and arrangements, if certain events occur within a specified period of time from transfer date, we have to provide limited recourse to the buyer to indemnify them for losses incurred for the remaining life of the loans. The maximum exposure to loss reported in Table 17.1 represents the outstanding principal balance of the loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse provisions or the maximum losses per the contractual agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss of the entire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote, and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale of collateral. We also provide representation and warranty guarantees on loans sold under the various recourse programs and arrangements. Our loss exposure relative to these guarantees is separately considered and provided for, as necessary, in determination of our liability for loan repurchases due to breaches of representation and warranties. \\nEXCHANGE AND CLEARING HOUSE GUARANTEES We are members \\nof several securities and derivatives exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S., that we use to clear our trades and those of our customers. It is common that all members in these organizations are required to collectively guarantee the performance of other members and of the organization. Our obligations under the guarantees are generally a pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a multiple of the guarantee fund we are required to maintain with these organizations. Some membership rules require members to assume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another member’s default or from non-member default losses after applying the guarantee fund. We have not recorded a liability for these arrangements as of the dates presented in Table 17.1 because we believe the likelihood of loss is remote. \\nOTHER GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS We have \\ncontingent performance arrangements related to various customer relationships and lease transactions. We are required to pay the counterparties to these agreements if third parties default on certain obligations. \\nUnder certain factoring arrangements, we may be required \\nto purchase trade receivables from third parties, if receivable debtors default on their payment obligations. \\nWe use certain third-party clearing agents to clear and settle \\ntransactions on behalf of some of our institutional brokerage customers. We indemnify the clearing agents against loss that could occur for non-performance by our customers on transactions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Transactions subject to the indemnifications may include customer obligations related to the settlement of margin accounts and short positions, such as written call options and securities borrowing transactions. \\nWe enter into other types of indemnification agreements in \\nthe ordinary course of business under which we agree to indemnify third parties against any damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with us. These relationships or transactions include those arising from service as a director or officer of the Company, underwriting agreements relating to our securities, acquisition agreements and various other business transactions or arrangements. Because the extent of our obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, we are unable to determine our potential future liability under these agreements. We do, however, record a liability for residential mortgage loans that we expect to repurchase pursuant to various representations and warranties. \\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit \\ncard transaction processing services through payment networks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in connection with payment and delivery disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the cardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. If we are unable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss for the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to make a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant processing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in connection with our merchant processing services because most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the merchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with these transactions by withholding future payments and requiring cash or other collateral. We estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back transaction. As of December 31, 2022, our potential maximum exposure was approximately $759.6 billion, and related losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant. \\nGUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES In the normal course of business, \\nthe Parent may provide counterparties with guarantees related to its subsidiaries’ obligations. These obligations are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $948 million and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent’s ability to address claims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent under the guarantee depends on the Parent’s receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If any of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that subsidiary’s assets. The rights of the Parent and the rights of the Parent’s creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the Parent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had commitments to purchase debt securities of $100 million and $18 million and commitments to purchase equity securities of $3.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. \\nAs part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing \\norganizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity to sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen events occur or are deemed likely to occur. Certain of these obligations are guarantees of other members’ performance and accordingly are included in \\nTable 17.1 in Other guarantees and \\nindemnifications. \\nWe have commitments to enter into resale and securities \\nborrowing agreements as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements with certain counterparties, including central clearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded contractual commitments for resale and securities borrowing agreements was \\n$19.9 billion and $11.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and \\n2021, respectively. The amount of our unfunded contractual commitments for repurchase and securities lending agreements was $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nGiven the nature of these commitments, they are excluded \\nfrom \\nTable 5.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 5 \\n(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses). \\nWells Fargo & Company 165 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 174}),\n",

The collateral that we pledge related to our trading activities may include our own collateral as well as collateral that we have received from third parties and have the right to repledge. All of the collateral we pledge related to trading activity is eligible to be repledged or sold by the secured party. NON-TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY As part of our liquidity \\nmanagement strategy, we may pledge loans, debt securities, and other financial assets to secure trust and public deposits, borrowings and letters of credit from Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and for other purposes as required or permitted by law or insurance statutory requirements. Substantially all of the non-trading activity pledged collateral is not eligible to be repledged or sold by the secured party. \\nVIE RELATED We pledge assets in connection with various types \\nof transactions entered into with VIEs. These pledged assets can only be used to settle the liabilities of those entities. \\nWe also have loans recorded on our consolidated balance \\nsheet which represent certain delinquent loans that are eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan securitizations.

These activitie        s are   \\nconducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a less         er  \\nextent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing         \\nactivities  primarily  involve high-quality, liquid securities such as       \\nU.S.  Treasury securities and government agency securities and,        \\nto a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity          \\nsecurities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We        \\naccount for these transactions as collateralized financings in         \\nwhich we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral.          We  \\nbelieve these financing transactions generally do not have         \\nmaterial credit risk given the collateral provided and the rela          ted  \\nmonitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements         involving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of our commercial lending business activities. \\nOFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED \\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 18.2 presents resale and repurchase \\nagreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) \\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to master securities lending agreements (MSLA). Where legally enforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. Collateralized financings, and those with a single counterparty, are presented net on our consolidated balance sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit balance sheet netting. The majority of transactions subject to these agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not eligible for balance sheet netting. \\nCollateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, \\nsuch as securities or loans, and is not netted on our consolidated \\nWells Fargo & Company 166 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 175}),\n",

All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior management. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments. \\nConsumer Banking and Lending offers diversified financial \\nproducts and services for consumers and small businesses with \\nannual sales generally up to $10 million. These financial products and services include checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards as well as home, auto, personal, and small business lending. \\nCommercial Banking provides financial solutions to private, \\nfamily owned and certain public companies. Products and services include banking and credit products across multiple industry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease products, and treasury management. \\nCorporate and Investment Banking delivers a suite of capital \\nmarkets, banking, and financial products and services to \\ncorporate, commercial real estate, government and institutional clients globally. Products and services include corporate banking, investment banking, treasury management, commercial real estate lending and servicing, equity and fixed income solutions as well as sales, trading, and research capabilities. \\nWealth and Investment Management provides personalized \\nwealth management, brokerage, financial planning, lending, \\nprivate banking, trust and fiduciary products and services to affluent, high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth clients. We operate through financial advisors in our brokerage and wealth offices, consumer bank branches, independent offices, and \\ndigitally through WellsTrade\\n® and Intuitive Investor ®. Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, \\nnet of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, \\nliquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable operating segments as well as our investment portfolio and affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In addition, Corporate includes all restructuring charges related to our efficiency initiatives. See Note 20 (Revenue and Expenses) for additional information on restructuring charges. Corporate also includes certain lines of business that management has determined are no longer consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company as well as results for previously divested businesses. \\nBasis of Presentation \\nFUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nREVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. \\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. \\nTAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results. \\nWells Fargo & Company 169 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 178}),\n",

Our revenue is generally recognized either immediately upon the completion of our service or over time as we perform services. Any services performed over time generally require that we render services each period and therefore we measure our progress in completing these services based upon the passage of time. \\nDEPOSIT-RELATED FEES are earned in connection with depository \\naccounts for commercial and consumer customers and include fees for account charges, overdraft services, cash network fees, wire transfer and other remittance fees, and safe deposit box fees. Account charges include fees for periodic account maintenance activities and event-driven services such as stop payment fees. Our obligation for event-driven services is satisfied at the time of the event when the service is delivered, while our obligation for maintenance services is satisfied over the course of each month. Our obligation for overdraft services is satisfied at the time of the overdraft. Cash network fees are earned for processing ATM transactions, and our obligation is completed upon settlement of ATM transactions. Wire transfer and other remittance fees consist of fees earned for providing funds transfer services and issuing cashier’s checks and money orders. Our obligation is satisfied at the time of the performance of the funds transfer service or upon issuance of the cashier’s check or money order. Safe deposit box fees are generally recognized over time as we provide the services. \\nINVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER ASSET-BASED FEES are earned \\nfor providing brokerage advisory, asset management and trust services. These fees were impacted by the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management, which closed in fourth quarter 2021. \\nFees from advisory account relationships with brokerage \\ncustomers are charged based on a percentage of the market value of the client’s assets. Services and obligations related to providing investment advice, active management of client assets, and assistance with selecting and engaging a third-party advisory manager are generally satisfied over a month or quarter. Trailing commissions are earned for selling shares to investors and our obligation is satisfied at the time shares are sold. However, these fees are received and recognized over time during the period the customer owns the shares and we remain the broker of record. The amount of trailing commissions is variable based on the length of time the customer holds the shares and on changes in the value of the underlying assets. \\nAsset management services include managing and \\nadministering assets, including mutual funds, and institutional separate accounts. Fees for these services are generally determined based on a tiered scale relative to the market value of assets under management (AUM). In addition to AUM, we have client assets under administration (AUA) that earn various administrative fees which are generally based on the extent of the services provided to administer the account. Services with AUM and AUA-based fees are generally satisfied over time. \\nTrust services include acting as a trustee or agent for \\npersonal trust and agency assets. Obligations for trust services are generally satisfied over time; however, obligations for activities that are transitional in nature are satisfied at the time of the transaction. COMMISSIONS AND BROKERAGE SERVICES FEES are earned for \\nproviding brokerage services. \\nCommissions from transactional accounts with brokerage \\ncustomers are earned for executing transactions at the client’s direction. Our obligation is generally satisfied upon the execution of the transaction and the fees are based on the size and number of transactions executed. \\nFees earned from other brokerage services include securities \\nclearance, omnibus and networking fees received from mutual fund companies in return for providing record keeping and other administrative services, and annual account maintenance fees charged to customers. Our obligation is satisfied at the time we provide the service which is generally at the time of the transaction. \\nINVESTMENT BANKING FEES are earned for underwriting debt and \\nequity securities, arranging syndicated loan transactions and performing other advisory services. Our obligation for these services is generally satisfied at closing of the transaction. \\nCARD FEES include credit and debit card interchange and network \\nrevenue and various card-related fees. Credit and debit card interchange and network revenue is earned on credit and debit card transactions conducted through payment networks such as Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Our obligation is satisfied concurrently with the delivery of services on a daily basis. Other card fees represent late fees, cash advance fees, balance transfer fees, and annual fees. \\nExpenses \\nOPERATING LOSSES We may incur expenses related to various \\nloss contingencies, such as customer remediation activities. We establish an accrued liability when a loss event is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our operating losses of $7.0 billion, $1.6 billion, and $3.5 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, included expenses primarily related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters. See Note 13 (Legal Actions) for additional information on accruals for legal actions. \\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES The Company began pursuing various \\ninitiatives to reduce expenses and create a more efficient and streamlined organization in third quarter 2020. Actions from these initiatives included (i) reorganizing and simplifying business processes and structures to improve internal operations and the customer experience, (ii) reducing headcount, (iii) optimizing third-party spending, including for our technology infrastructure, and (iv) rationalizing our branch and administrative locations, which may include consolidations and closures. Substantially all of the restructuring charges were personnel expenses related to severance costs associated with headcount reductions with payments made over time in accordance with our severance plan as well as payments for other employee benefit costs such as incentive compensation. \\nRestructuring charges are recorded as a component of \\nnoninterest expense on our consolidated statement of income. Changes in estimates represent adjustments to noninterest expense based on refinements to previously estimated amounts, which may reflect trends such as higher voluntary employee attrition as well as changes in business activities. \\nTable 20.2 provides details on our restructuring charges. \\nWells Fargo & Company 172 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 181}),\n",

The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on July 1, 2009, and no new benefits accrue after that date. \\nPrior to July 1, 2009, eligible employees’ Cash Balance Plan \\naccounts were allocated a compensation credit based on a \\npercentage of their certified compensation; the freeze discontinued the allocation of compensation credits after June 30, 2009. Investment credits continue to be allocated to participants’ accounts based on their accumulated balances. \\nWe did not make a contribution to our Cash Balance Plan in \\n2022. We do not expect that we will be required to make a \\ncontribution to the Cash Balance Plan in 2023. For the nonqualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, there is no minimum required contribution beyond the amount needed to fund benefit payments. \\nWe recognize settlement losses for our Cash Balance Plan \\nbased on an assessment of whether lump sum benefit payments will, in aggregate for the year, exceed the sum of its annual service and interest cost (threshold). Settlement losses of $221 million and $133 million were recognized during 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing the pro rata portion of the net loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) based on the percentage reduction in the Cash Balance Plan’s projected benefit obligation attributable to 2022 and 2021 lump sum payments (included in the “Benefits paid” line in Table 21.1 ). \\nAdditionally, we sponsored the Wells Fargo Canada \\nCorporation Pension Plan to employees in Canada (Canada Pension Plan), \\na defined benefit retirement plan. In June 2022, an \\nannuity contract was entered into that effected a full settlement of this Canada Pension Plan, resulting in a plan settlement of $29 million and a settlement loss of $5 million. \\nOur nonqualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and \\nprovide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to certain eligible employees. The benefits under these plans were frozen in prior years. \\nOther benefits include health care and life insurance benefits \\nprovided to certain retired employees. We reserve the right to amend, modify or terminate any of these benefits at any time. \\nThe information set forth in the following tables is based on \\ncurrent actuarial reports using the measurement date of December 31 for our pension and postretirement benefit plans. \\nTable 21.1 presents the changes in the benefit obligation \\nand the fair value of plan assets, the funded status, and the amounts recognized on our consolidated balance sheet.

In determining the end of year           \\nbenefit obligation, we assumed an average annual increase of          \\napproximately  13.90%  for health care costs in      2023. This rate is     \\nassumed to trend down     0.60%-1.50%  per year until the trend      \\nrate reaches an ultimate rate of       4.50%  in  2032.

Our overall investment strategy is designed to provide our Cash Balance Plan with a moderate amount of long-term growth opportunities while ensuring that risk is mitigated through diversification across numerous asset classes and various investment strategies, coupled with an investment strategy for the fixed income assets that is generally designed to approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the Cash Balance Plan’s benefit obligations. The Cash Balance Plan currently has a target asset allocation mix comprised of the following ranges: 75%-85% fixed income, 10%-20% equities, and 0%-10% in real estate, private equity and other investments. The Employee Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes several members of senior management, formally reviews the investment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan on a quarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and periodic asset/ liability evaluations are also conducted. Other benefit plan assets include (1) assets held in a 401(h) \\ntrust, which are invested with a target mix of 50%-60% equities and 40%-50% fixed income, and (2) assets held in the Retiree Medical Plan Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust, which are predominantly invested in fixed income securities and cash. Members of the EBRC formally review the investment risk and performance of these assets on a quarterly basis. \\nProjected Benefit Payments \\nFuture benefits that we expect to pay under the pension and other benefit plans are presented in Table 21.7. \\nTable 21.7: Projected Benefit Payments \\nPension benefits \\n(in millions) Qualified Non-\\nqualified Other \\nbenefits \\nPeriod ended December 31, \\n2023 $ 690 43 31 \\n2024 654 42 30 \\n2025 646 40 30 \\n2026 643 38 28 \\n2027 640 37 27 \\n2028-2032 3,052 155 119 \\nWells Fargo & Company 176 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 185}),\n",

The NAV per share is quoted on a private market that is not active; however, the NAV per share is based on underlying investments traded on an active market. This group of assets also includes investments in registered investment companies valued at the NAV per share held at year-end and in interest-bearing bank accounts. \\nLong Duration, Intermediate (Core), High-Yield, and \\nInternational Fixed Income – includes investments traded on the \\nsecondary markets; prices are measured by using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models, and discounted cash flow analyses using significant inputs observable in the market where available, or a combination of multiple valuation techniques. This group of assets also includes highly liquid government securities such as U.S. Treasuries, limited partnerships valued at the NAV, registered investment companies, and collective investment funds described above. \\nDomestic, Global, International and Emerging Market Stocks – \\ninvestments in exchange-traded equity securities are valued at quoted market values. This group of assets also includes investments in registered investment companies and collective investment funds described above. \\nReal Estate –includes investments in exchange-traded equity \\nsecurities, registered investment companies, and collective investment funds described above. \\nHedge Funds / Absolute Return – includes investments in \\ncollective investment funds as described above. \\nOther – insurance contracts that are stated at cash surrender \\nvalue. This group of assets also includes investments in registered investment companies and collective investment funds described above. \\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value \\ncalculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or \\nreflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans \\nWe sponsor a qualified defined contribution retirement plan, the \\nWells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan). Under the 401(k) Plan, after 1 month of service, eligible employees may contribute up to 50% of their certified compensation, subject to statutory limits. \\nEffective January 2021, we implemented the following        \\nchanges to the 401(k) Plan employer contributions: (1) with          \\nsome exceptions, employees with     one year   of service must be     \\nemployed in a benefit-eligible position on December 15; (2)          \\nadded a new non-discretionary base contribution of        1% of   \\ncertified compensation for employees with annual compensation        \\nof less than $75,000; (3) replaced the discretionary profit sha         ring  \\ncontribution with a discretionary contribution for eligible        \\nemployees with annual compensation of less than $150,000; and          \\n(4)  revised the matching contribution vesting and timing. Eligible         \\nemployees are   100% vested in their base and discretionary        \\ncontributions after   three years   of service. A three-year service      \\nvesting requirement for matching contributions applies to        \\nemployees hired after December 31, 2020. Base and matching          \\ncontributions are made annually at year-end, and the         \\ndiscretionary contribution, if awarded, is made no later than t          he  \\ndue date for the Company’s federal income tax return (includin          g  \\nextensions) for the plan year. Additionally, we added installme         nt  \\npayment options to the existing lump sum and partial lump sum            \\ndistribution options and added optional advisory services.       \\nPrior to January 2021, eligible employees who completed \\none year of service were eligible to receive the matching contributions quarterly, which are dollar for dollar up to 6% of certified compensation, and a discretionary profit sharing contribution up to 4% of certified compensation, if awarded, paid following the plan year. Matching contributions were 100% vested, and the discretionary profit sharing contributions required three years of vesting service (no change). \\nTotal defined contribution retirement plan expenses were \\n$1.0 billion in 2022, and $1.1 billion in both 2021 and 2020. \\nWells Fargo & Company 178 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 187}),\n",

See Note 24 (Other Comprehensive Income) for additional information. \\nWe have determined that a valuation allowance is required \\nfor \\n2022 in the amount of $232 million, attributable to deferred \\ntax assets in various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized due to lack of sources of taxable income, limitations on carry back of losses or credits and the inability to implement tax planning to realize these deferred tax assets. We have concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized based on our history of earnings, sources of taxable income in carry back periods, and our ability to implement tax planning strategies. \\nTable 22.4 presents the components of the deferred tax \\nassets related to net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carry forwards at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2022. \\nTable 22.4: Deferred Tax Assets Related To Net Operating Loss and \\nTax Credit Carry Forwards (1) \\n(in millions) Dec 31, \\n2022 \\nU.S. Federal NOLs $ 3,244 \\nU.S. Federal tax credits 1,221 \\nU.S. State NOLs and credits 974 \\nNon-U.S. NOLs and credits 74 \\nTotal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 5,513 \\n(1) U.S. Federal NOLs have no expiration date. The remaining balances, if not utilized, mostly exp\\nire in varying amounts through December\\xa031, 2042. We do not intend to distribute earnings of certain non-U.S. \\nsubsidiaries in a taxable manner, and therefore intend to limit distributions to non-U.S. earnings previously taxed in the U.S., that would qualify for the 100% dividends received deduction, and that would not result in any significant state or non-U.S. taxes. All other undistributed non-U.S. earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and the related tax liability on these earnings is insignificant. \\nTable 22.5 presents the change in unrecognized tax benefits. \\nTable 22.5: Change in Unrecognized Tax Benefits \\nYear ended\\xa0\\n December 31,\\xa0\\n(in millions) 2022 2021 \\nBalance, beginning of period $ 5,218 4,826 \\nAdditions: \\nFor tax positions related to the current year 695 441 \\nFor tax positions related to prior years 358 259 \\nReductions: \\nFor tax positions related to prior years (514) (124) \\nLapse of statute of limitations (13) (164) \\nSettlements with tax authorities (307) (20) \\nBalance, end of period $ 5,437 5,218 \\nOf the $5.4 billion of unrecognized tax benefits at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, approximately $3.6 billion would, if recognized, affect the effective tax rate. The remaining $1.8\\xa0billion of unrecognized tax benefits relates to income tax positions on temporary differences. \\nWe account for interest and penalties related to income tax \\nliabilities as a component of income tax expense. As of December\\xa031, 2022\\n and 2021, we have accrued expenses of \\napproximately $436 million and $914 million, respectively, for interest and penalties. In 2022 and 2021, we recognized income tax benefit, net of tax, of $385\\xa0million and $33 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties. \\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income \\ntax in numerous state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are routinely examined by tax authorities in these various jurisdictions. With few exceptions, Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries are not subject to federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax examinations for taxable years prior to 2011. It is reasonably possible that one or more of the examinations or appeals may be resolved within the next twelve months resulting in a decrease of up to \\n$1.4 billion of \\nour gross unrecognized tax benefits.

The G-SIB surcharge is not applicable to the Bank. In addition, the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratio requirements for the Company included a stress capital buffer of 3.20% under the Standardized Approach and a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% under the Advanced Approach. The capital ratio requirements for the Bank included a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Company is required to maintain these risk-based capital ratios and to maintain an SLR of at least 5.00% (composed of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The Bank is required to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00% to be considered well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy rules. Capital Planning Requirements \\nThe FRB’s capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain large bank holding companies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo. The FRB conducts an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and has also published guidance regarding its supervisory expectations for capital planning, including capital policies regarding the process relating to common stock dividend and repurchase decisions in the FRB’s SR Letter 15-18. The Parent’s ability to make certain capital distributions is subject to the requirements of the capital plan rule and is also subject to the Parent meeting or exceeding certain regulatory capital minimums. \\nWells Fargo & Company 184 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 193}),\n",

These covered transactions may not exceed 10% of the bank’s capital and surplus (which for this purpose represents Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, as calculated under the risk-based capital rules, plus the balance of the ACL excluded from Tier 2 capital) with any single nonbank affiliate and 20% of the bank’s capital and surplus with all its nonbank affiliates. Covered transactions that are extensions of credit may require collateral to be pledged to provide added security to the bank. \\nAdditionally, federal laws and regulations limit the \\ndividends that a national bank may pay. Dividends that may be paid by a national bank without the express approval of the OCC are generally limited to that bank’s retained net income for the preceding two calendar years plus net income up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net income, as defined by the OCC, consists of net income less dividends declared during the period. Our national bank subsidiaries could have declared additional dividends of $6.4 billion at December 31, 2022, without obtaining prior regulatory approval. We have elected to retain higher capital at our national bank subsidiaries to meet internal capital targets, which are set above regulatory requirements. \\nOur nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal \\nand state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year. In addition, under a Support Agreement dated June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, among Wells Fargo & Company, the parent holding company (Parent), WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (IHC), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Based on retained earnings at December 31, 2022, our nonbank subsidiaries could have declared additional dividends of $26.9 billion at December 31, 2022, without obtaining prior regulatory approval.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), \\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – \\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated \\nFebruary 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \\nBasis for Opinion \\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an \\nopinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nCritical Audit Matters \\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \\nAssessment of the allowance for credit losses for loans (ACL) \\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s ACL as of December 31, 2022 was \\n$13.6 billion. The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk characteristics utilizing multiple credit loss models. The Company estimated the ACL for commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected exposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which estimate expected credit losses in the portfolio based on individual risk characteristics of the loans and historical experience of probability of default and severity of loss estimates. The Company’s credit loss models utilize economic variables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts multiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to estimate expected credit losses. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to the long-term average for the forecasted economic variables based on historical observations over multiple economic cycles. A portion of the ACL is comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. \\nWe identified the assessment of the ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and \\nknowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the ACL. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the ACL methodology for collectively evaluated loans, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) probability of default and severity of loss estimates, significant economic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the historical observation period, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the adjustments for qualitative factors that may not be adequately captured in the loss models. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of certain credit loss models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. \\nWells Fargo & Company 188 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 197}),\n",

In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \\n•\\t\\t evaluating the Company’s ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \\n•\\t\\t evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the development, assessment and performance testing of certain \\ncredit loss models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices \\n•\\t\\t assessing the conceptual soundness of the credit loss models, including the selection of certain assumptions, by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use \\n•\\t\\t evaluating the methodology used to develop the forecasted economic scenarios, the selection of underlying assumptions and the weighting of scenarios by comparing it to the Company’s business environment \\n•\\t\\t assessing the forecasted economic scenarios through comparison to publicly available forecasts \\n•\\t\\t testing the historical observation period and reasonable and supportable forecast periods to evaluate the length of each period \\n•\\t\\t testing individual credit risk ratings for a selection of commercial loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral \\n•\\t\\t evaluating the methods and assumptions used to develop certain qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the ACL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models. \\nWe also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the ACL estimates by evaluating the: \\n•\\t\\t cumulative results of the audit procedures \\n•\\t\\t qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices \\n•\\t\\t potential bias in the accounting estimates. \\nAssessment of the residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \\nAs discussed in Notes 1, 6, 15, and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s residential MSR asset as of \\nDecember 31, 2022 was $9.3 billion on an underlying loan servicing portfolio of $681 billion. The Company recognizes MSRs when it retains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans it originated or purchases servicing rights from third parties and has elected to carry its residential MSRs at fair value with periodic changes reflected in earnings. The Company uses a valuation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, which incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These assumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals. \\nWe identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including \\nspecialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs. Specifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity used to evaluate the following assumptions because they are unobservable and the sensitivity of changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the valuation (1) prepayment rates, (2) discount rates, and (3) cost to service. There was also a high degree of subjectivity and potential for management bias related to updates made to significant assumptions due to changes in market conditions, mortgage interest rates, or servicing standards. \\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested \\nthe operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the assessment of residential MSRs, including controls over the: \\n•\\t\\t assessment of the valuation model \\n•\\t\\t evaluation of the significant assumptions (prepayment rates, discount rates, and cost to service) used in determining the MSR \\nfair value \\n•\\t\\t comparison of the MSR fair value to independent appraisals. \\nWells Fargo & Company 189 ', metadata={'source': '/content/Wells Fargo - Dataset.pdf', 'page': 198}),\n",

The Compan y tests goodw ill for impairment annu ally in the fourth quarter, or more frequentl y if events or \\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, by comparing the fair value of the reportin g unit with its \\ncarryin g amoun t, including goodwill . Management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using an income approach and a \\nmarket approach . The income approac h is a discou nted cash flow (DCF) analysis that incorporates assumpt ions includin g financial \\nforecasts, a terminal value based on an assumed long-term growth rate, and a discoun t rate.T he financial forecasts include future \\nexpectation s of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and considerations related to future business activities. The \\nforecasted cash flows are discou nted using a rate derived from a capita l asset pricin g model which produce s an estimated cost of \\nequity to the report ing unit. The market approac h utilizes obse rvable market data from compara ble publicly traded compa nies and \\nincor porate s assumptions includin g the selection of comparabl e companies and a control premium representative of management’s \\nexpectatio n of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporti ng unit. \\nWe identified the assess ment of the goodw ill impairment for the Consumer Lending reporting unit, which had $7.1 billion of \\nallocated goodwil l as of December 31, 2022 , as a critical audit matter.
